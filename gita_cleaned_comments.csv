Hrsikesa as if [he was] smiling spoke to him who was sinking in despondency in between two armies,O King to him who was thus sorrowing between the two armies Sri Krsna spoke the following words as if smiling (by way of ridicule),O descendant of Bharata to him who was sorrowing between the two armies Hrsikesa mocking as it were said these words:,,Karpanyaetc upto vacah By the portion 'in between the two armies' etc [the Sage] indicates this : Beings possessed by doubt Arjuna had not abstained from the war totally; for he says thus : 'Please teach me who am taking refuge in you' Therefore while he still remains just in between both knowledge and ignorance he is taught by the glorious Bhagavat,,,,,,"And here the text commencing from 'But seeing the army of the Pandavas' () and ending with '(he) verily became silent telling Him (Govinda) ""I shall not fight""' is to be explained as revealing the cause of the origin of the defect in the from of sorrow delusion etc [Delusion means want of discrimination Etc stands for the secondary manifestations of sorrow and delusion as also ignorance which is the root cause of all these] which are the sources of the cycles of births and deaths of creatures Thus indeed Ajuna's own sorrow and delusion cuased by the ideas of affection parting etc originating from the erroneous belief 'I belong to these; they belong to me' with regard to kingdom [See note under verse Tr] elders sons comrades wellwishers () kinsmen () relatives () and friends have been shown by him with the words 'How can I (fight)৷৷in battle (against) Bhisma' () etc It is verily because his discriminating insight was overwhelmed by sorrow and delusion that even though he had become engaged in battle out of his own accord as a duty of the Ksatriyas he desisted from that war and chose to undertake other's duties like living on alms etc It is thus that in the case of all creatures whose minds come under the sway of the defects of sorrow delusion etc there verily follows as a matter of course abandoning their own duties and resorting to prohibited ones Even when they engage in their own duties their actions with speech mind body etc are certainly motivated by hankering for rewards and are accompanied by egoism [Egoism consists in thinking that one is the agent of some work and the enjoyer of its reward] Such being the case the cycle of births and deaths characterized by passing through desireable and undesirable births and meeting with happiness sorrow etc [From virtuous deeds follow attainment of heaven and happiness From unvirtuous sinful deeds follow births as beasts and other lowly beings and sorrow From the performance of both virtuous and sinful deeds follows birth as a human being with a mixture of happiness and sorrow] from the accumulation of virtue and vice continues unendingly Thus sorrow and delusion are therefore the sources of the cycles of births and deaths And their cessation comes from nothing other than the knowledge of the Self which is preceded by the renunciation of all duties Hence wishing to impart that (knowledge of the Self) for favouring the whole world Lord Vasudeva making Arjuna the medium said 'You grieve for those who are not to be grieved for' etc As to that some (opponents) [According to AG the opponent is the Vrttikara who in the opinion of A Mahadeva Sastri is none other than Bodhayana referred to in Sankaracarya's commentary on BS Tr] say: Certainly Liberation cannot be attained merely from continuance in the knowledge of the Self which is preceded by renunciation of all duties and is independent of any other factor What then? The wellascertained conclusion of the whole of the Gita is that Liberation is attained through Knowledge associated with rites and duties like Agnihotra etc prescribed in the Vedas and the Smrtis And as an indication of this point of view they ote (the verses): 'On the other hand if you will not fight this righteous (battle)' (); 'Your right is for action (rites and duties) alone' (); 'Therefore you undertake action (rites and duties) itself' () etc Even this objection should not be raised that Vedic rites and duties lead to sin since they involve injury etc' Objection: How? Opponent: The duties of the Ksatriyas charaterized by war do not lead to sin when undertaken as one's duty even though they are extremely cruel since they involve violence against elders brothers sons and others And from the Lord's declaration that when they are not performed 'then forsaking your own duty and fame you will incur sin' () it stands out as (His) clearly stated foregone conclusion that one's own duties prescribed in such texts as '(One shall perform Agnihotra) as long as one lives' etc and actions which involve crutely to animals etc are not sinful Vedantin: That is wrong because of the assertion of the distinction between firm adherence (nistha) to Knowledge and to action which are based on two (different) convictions (buddhi) The nature of the Self the supreme Reality determined by the Lord in the text beginning with 'Those who are not to be grieved for' () and running to the end of the verse 'Even considering your own duty' () is called Sankhya Sankhyabuddhi [Sankhya is that correct (samyak) knowledge of the Vedas which reveals (khyayate) the reality of the Self the supreme Goal The Reality under discussion which is related to this sankhya by way of having been revealed by it is Sankhya] (Conviction about the Reality) is the conviction with regard to That (supreme Reality) arising from the ascertainment of the meaning of the context [Ascertainment৷৷of the context ie of the meaning of the verses starting from 'Never is this One born and never does It die' etc ()] that the Self is not an agent because of the absence in It of the six kinds of changes viz birth etc [Birth continuance growth transformation decay and death] Sankhyas are those men of Knowledge to whom that (conviction) becomes natural Prior to the rise of this Conviction (Sankhyabuddhi) the ascertained [Ast and AG omit this word 'ascertainment nirupana'Tr] of the performance of the disciplines leading to Liberation which is based on a discrimination between virtue and vice [And adoration of God] and which presupposes the Self's difference from the body etc and Its agentship and enjoyership is called Yoga The conviction with regard to that (Yoga) is Yogabuddhi The performers of rites and duties for whom this (conviction) is appropriate are called yogis Accordingly the two distinct Convictions have been pointed out by the Lord in the verse 'This wisdom (buddhi) has been imparted to you from the standpoint of Selfrealization (Sankhya) But listen to this (wisdom) from the standpoint of (Karma) yoga' () And of these two the Lord will separately speak with reference to the Sankhyas of the firm adherence to the Yoga of Knowledge [Here Yoga and Knowledge are identical Yoga is that through which one gets connected identified with Brahman] which is based on Sankyabuddhi in 'Two kinds of adherences were spoken of by Me in the form of the Vedas in the days of yore' [This portion is ascending to G1Pr and AA; Ast omits this and otes exactly the first line of By saying 'in the form of the Vedas' the Lord indicates that the Vedas which are really the knowledge inherent in God and issue out of Him are identical with HimselfTr] similarly in 'through the Yoga of Action for the yogis' () He will separately speak of the firm adherence to the Yoga [Here also Karma and Yoga are identical and lead to Liberation by bringing about purity of heart which is followed by steadfastness in Knowledge] of Karma which is based on Yogabuddhi (Conviction about Yoga) Thus the two kinds of steadfastness that based on the conviction about the nature of the Self and that based on the conviction about rites and duties have been distinctly spoken of by the Lord Himself who saw that the coexistence of Knowledge and rites and duties is not possible in the same person they being based on the convictions of nonagentship and agentship unity and diversity (respectively) As is this teaching about the distinction (of the two adherences) just so has it been revealed in the Satapatha Brahmana: 'Desiring this world (the Self) alone monks and Brahmanas renounce their homes' (cf Br ) After thus enjoining renunciation of all rites and duties it is said in continuation 'What shall we acheive through childeren we who have attained this Self this world (result)' [The earlier otation implies an injuction (vidhi) for renunciation and the second is an arthavada or an emphasis on that injunction Arthavada: A sentence which usually recommends a vidhi or precept by stating the good arising from its proper observance and the evils arising from its omission; and also by adducing historical instances in its supportVSA] Again there itself it is said that before accepting a wife a man is in his natural state [The state of ignorance owing to nonrealization of Reality Such a person is a Brahmacarin who goes to a teacher for studying the Vedas] And (then) after his eniries into rites and duties [The Brahmacarin first studies the Vedas and then enires into their meaning Leaving his teacher's house after completing his course he becomes a house holder] 'he' for the attainment of the three worlds [This world the world of manes and heavenTr] 'desired' (see Br ) as their means a son and the two kinds of wealth consists of rites and duties that lead to the world of manes and the divine wealth of acisition of vidya (meditation) which leads to heaven In this way it is shown that rites and duties enjoined by the Vedas etc are meant only for one who is unenlightened and is passessed of desire And in the text 'After renouncing they take to mendicancy' (see Br ) the injunction to renounce is only for one who desires the world that is the Self and who is devoid of hankering (for anything else) Now if the intention of the Lord were the combination of Knowledge with Vedic rites and duties then this utterance (of the Lord) () about the distinction would have been illogical Nor would Arjuna's estion 'If it be Your opinion that wisdom (Knowledge) is superior to action (rites and duties)৷৷' etc () be proper If the Lord had not spoken earlier of the impossibility of the pursuit of Knowledge and rites and duties by the same person (at the same time) then how could Arjuna falsely impute to the Lord by saying 'If it be your opinion that wisdom is superior to action৷৷৷৷' (of having spoken) what was not heard by him viz the higher status of Knolwedge over rites and duties? Morevoer if it be that the combination of Knowledge with rites and duties was spoken of for all then it stands enjoined ipso facto on Arjuna as well Therefore if instruction had been given for practising both then how could the estion about 'either of the two' arise as in 'Tell me for certain one of these (action and renunciation) by which I may attain the highest Good' ()? Indeed when a physician tells a patient who has come for a cure of his biliousness that he should take things which are sweet and soothing there can arise no such reest as 'Tell me which one of these two is to be taken as a means to cure biliousness'! Again if it be imagined that Arjuna put the estion because of his noncomprehension of the distinct meaning of what the Lord had said even then the Lord ought to have answered in accordance with the estion: 'The combination of Knowledge with rites and duties was spoken of by Me Why are you confused thus?' On the other hand it was not proper to have answered 'Two kinds of steadfastness were spoken of by Me it the days of yore' in a way that was inconsistent and at variance with the estion Nor even do all the statements about distinction etc become logical if it were intended that Knowledge was to be combined with rites and duties enjoined by the Smrtis only Besides the accusation in the sentence 'Why then do you urge me to horrible action' () becomes illogical on the part of Arjuna who knew that fighting was a Ksatriya's natural duty enjoined by the Smrtis Therefore it is not possible for anyone to show that in the scripture called the Gita there is any combination even in the least of Knowledge of the Self with rites and duties enjoined by the Srutis or the Smrtis But in the case of a man who had engaged himself in rites and duties because of ignorance and defects like the attachment and then got his mind purified through sacrifices charities or austerities (see Br ) there arises the knowledge about the supreme Reality that all this is but One and Brahman is not an agent (of any action) With regard to him although there is a cessation of rites and duties as also of the need for them yet what may appear as his diligent continuance just as before in those rites and duties for setting an example before people that is no action in which case it could have stood combined with Knowledge Just as the actions of Lord Vasudeva in the form of performance of the duty of a Ksatriya do not get combined with Knowledge for the sake of achieving the human goal (Liberation) similar is the case with the man of Knowledge because of the absence of hankering for results and agentship Indeed a man who has realized the Truth does not thingk 'I am doing (this)' nor does he hanker after its result Again as for instance person hankering after such desirable things as heaven etc may light up a fire for performing such rites as Agnihotra etc which are the mans to attain desirable things; [The Ast reading is: Agnihotradikarmalaksanadharmaanusthanaya for the performance of duties in the form of acts like Agnihotra etcTr] then while he is still engaged in the performance of Agnihotra etc as the means for the desirable things the desire may get destroyed when the rite is halfdone He may nevertheless continue the performance of those very Agnihotra etc; but those performance of those very Agnihotra etc; but those Agnihotra etc cannot be held to be for this personal gain Accordingly does the Lord also show in various places that 'even while perfroming actions' he does not act 'he does not become tainted' () As for the texts '৷৷as was performed earlier by the ancient ones' () 'For Janaka and others strove to attain Liberation through action itself' () they are to be understood analytically Objection: How so? Vedantin: As to that if Janaka and others of old remained engaged in activity even though they were knowers of Reality they did so for preventing people from going astray while remaining established in realization verily through the knowledge that 'the organs rest (act) on the objects of the organs' () The idea is this that though the occasion for renunciation of activity did arise they remained established in realization along with actions; they did not give up their rites and duties On the other hand if they were not knowers of Reality then the explanation should be this; Through the discipline of dedicating rites and duties to God Janaka and others remained established in perfection (samsiddhi) either in the form of purification of mind or rise of Knowledge This very idea [The idea that rites and duties become the cause of Knowledge through the purification of the mind] will be expressed by the Lord in '(the yogis) undertake action for the purification of oneself (ie of the heart or the mind)' () After having said 'A human being achieves success by adoring Him through his own duties' [By performing one's own duty as enjoined by scriptures and dedicating their results to God one's mind becomes purified Then through Gods grace one becomes fit for steadfastness in Knowledge From that steadfatness follows Liberation Therefore rites and duites do not directly lead to Liberation (See Common under ) () He will again speak of the steadfastness in Knowledge of a person who has attained success in the text '(Understand৷৷from Me৷৷that process by which) one who has achieved success attains Brahman' () So the definite conclusion in the Gita is that Liberation is attained only from the knowledge of Reality and not from its combination with action And by pointing out in the relevant contexts the (aforesaid) distinction we shall show how this conclusion stands That being so Lord Vasudeva found that for Arjuna whose mind was thus confused about what ought to be done [The ast and AA have an additional word mithyajnanavatah meaning 'who had false ignorance'Tr] and who was sunk in a great ocean of sorrow there could be no rescue other than through the knowledge of the Self And desiring to rescue Arjuna from that He said '(You grieve for) those who are not to be grieved for' etc by way of introducing the knowledge of the Self [In this Gita there are three distinct parts each part consisting of six chapters These three parts deal with the three words of the great Upanisadic saying 'Tattvamasi thou art That' with a view to finding out their real meanings The first six chapters are concerned with the word tvam (thou); the following six chapters determine the meaning of the word tat (that); and the last six reveal the essential identity of tvam and tat The disciplines necessary for realization this identity are stated in the relevant places]",,,Sanjaya said Thus the Lord the Supreme Person introduced the Sastra regarding the self for the sake of Arjuna whose natural courage was lost due to love and compassion in a misplaced situation who thought war to be unrighteous even though it was the highest duty for warriors (Ksatriyas) and who took refuge in Sri Krsna to know what his right duty was thinking that Arjuna's delusion would not come to an end except by the knowledge of the real nature of the self and that war was an ordained duty here which when freed from attachment to fruits is a means for selfknowledge Thus has it been said by Sri Yamunacarya: 'The introduction to the Sastra was begun for the sake of Arjuna whose mind was agitated by misplaced love and compassion and by the delusion that righteousness was unrighteousness and who took refuge in Sri Krsna' The Supreme Person spoke these words as if smiling and looking at Arjuna who was thus overcome by grief resulting from ignorance about the real nature of the body and the self but was nevertheless speaking about duty as if he had an understanding that the self is distinct from the body and while he (Arjuna) torn between contradictory ideas had suddenly become inactive standing between the two armies that were getting ready to fight Sri Krsna said as if in ridicule to Arjuna the words beginning with 'There never was a time when I did not exist' (II ) and ending with 'I will release you from all sins; grieve not!' (XVIII ) which have for their contents the real nature of the self of the Supreme Self and of the paths of work (Karma) knowledge (Jnana) and devotion (Bhakti) which constitute the means for attaining the highest spiritual fulfilment

Nor is it right to say that Its lamentability is due only to Its travel in another body For in that case It should be lamented for even when the stage of youth etc is attained In this manner the two ideas [the Lord] relates :,,,,,,Bhisma Drona and others are not to be grieved for because they are of noble character and are eternal in their real nature With regard to them asocyan who are not to be grieved for; tvam you; anvasocah grieve (thinking) 'They die because of me; without them what shall I do with dominion and enjoyment?'; ca and; bhasase you speak; prajnavadan words of wisdom words used by men of wisdom of intelligence The idea is 'Like one mad you show in yourself this foolishness and learning which are contradictory' Because panditah the learned the knowers of the Self panda means wisdon about the Self; those indeed who have this are panditah one the authority of the Upanisadic text '৷৷the knowers of Brahman having known all about scholarship৷৷' (Br ) ['Therefore the knowers of Brahman having known all about scholorship should try to live upon that strength which comes of Knowledge; having known all about this strength as well as scholorship he becomes meditative; having known all about both meditativeness and its opposite he becomes a knower of Brahman'] ; na anusocanti do not grieve for; gatasun the departed whose life has become extinct; agatasun ca and for those who have not departed whose life has not left the living The ideas is 'Your are sorrowing for those who are eternal in the real sense and who are not to be grieved for Hence your are a fool!',,,The Lord said You are grieving for those who do not deserve to be grieved for You also speak words of wisdom about the nature of the body and the self as follows: 'The ancestors fall degraded deprived of the ritual oblations of food and water' (I ) There is no reason for such grief for those who possess the knowledge of the nature of the body and the self Those who know the exact truth will not grieve for those bodies from which life has departed and for those from whome the principle of life has not departed They do not grieve for bodies or souls Hence in you this contradiction is visible your grief at the thought 'I shall slay them?' and at the same time your talk about righteousness and unrighteousness as if it were the result of knowledge of the self as distinct from the body Therefore you do not know the nature of the body nor of the self which is distinct from the body and is eternal Nor do you know of duties like war etc which (as duty) constitute the means for the attainment of the self nor of the fact that this war (which forms a duty in the present context) if fought without any selfish desire for results is a means for the attainment of the knowledge of the true nature of the self The implied meaning is this: This self verily is not dependent on the body for Its existence nor is It subjected to destruction on the death of the body as there is no birth or death for It Therefore there is no cause for grief But the body is insentient by nature is subject to change and its birth and death are natural; thus it (body) too is not to be grieved for First listen about the nature of the self

Because they are eternal How? Na tu eva but certainly it is not (a fact); that jatu at any time; aham I ; na asam did not exist; on the contrary I did exist The idea is that when the bodies were born or died in the past I existed eternally [Here Ast adds ghatadisu viyadiva like Space in pot etcTr] Similarly na tvam nor is it that you did not exist;

na bhavisyamah shall cease to exist; atah param after this even after the destruction of this body On the contrary we shall exist The meaning is that even in all the three times (past present and future) we are eternal in our nature as the Self The plural number (in we) is used following the diversity of the bodies but not in the sense of the multiplicity of the Self,,,Indeed I the Lord of all who is eternal was never nonexistent but existed always It is not that these selves like you who are subject to My Lordship did not exist; you have always existed It is not that 'all of us' I and you shall cease to be 'in the future' ie beyond the present time; we shall always exist Even as no doubt can be entertainted that I the Supreme Self and Lord of all am eternal likewise you (Arjuna and all others) who are embodied selves also should be considered eternal The foregoing implies that the difference between the Lord the sovereign over all and the individual selves as also the differences among the individual selves themselves are real This has been declared by the Lord Himself For different terms like 'I' 'you' 'these' 'all' and 'we' have been used by the Lord while explaining the truth of eternality in order to remove the misunderstanding of Arjuna who is deluded by ignorance [Now follows a refutation of the Upadhi theory of Bhaskara and the Ignorance theory of the Advaitins which deny any ultimate difference between the Lord and the Jivas] If we examine (Bhaskara's) theory of Upadhis (adjuncts) which states that the apparent differences among Jivas are due to adjuncts it will have to be admitted that mention about differences is out of place when explaining the ultimate truth because the theory holds that there are no such differences in reality But that the differences mentioned by the Lord are natural is taught by the Sruti also: 'Eternal among eternals sentient among sentients the one who fulfils the desires of the many' (Sve U VI Ka U V ) The meaning of the text is: Among the eternal sentient beings who are countless He who is the Supreme Spirit fulfils the desires of all' As regards the theory of the Advaitins that the perception of difference is brought about by ignorance only and is not really real the Supreme Being whose vision must be true and who therefore must have an immediate cognition of the differencelss and immutable and eternal consciousness as constituting the nature of the Atman in all authenticity and who must thery be always free from all ignorance and its effects cannot possibly perceive the socalled difference arising from ignornace It is therefore unimaginable that He engages himself in activities such as teaching which can proceed only from such a perception of differences arising from ignorance The argument that the Supreme Being though possessed of the understanding of nomduality can still have the awareness of such difference persisting even after sublation just as a piece of cloth may have been burnt up and yet continues to have the appearance of cloth and that such a continuance of the subltated does not cause bondage such an argument is invalid in the light of another analogy of a similar kind namely the perception of the mirage which when understood to be what it is does not make one endeavour to fetch water therefrom In the same way even if the impression of difference negated by the nondualistic illumination persists it cannot impel one to activities such as teaching; for the object to whom the instruction is to be imparted is discovered to be unreal The idea is that just as the discovery of the nonexistence of water in a mirage stops all effort to get water from it so also when all duality is sublated by illumination no activity like teaching disciples etc can take place Nor can the Lord be conceived as having been previously ignorant and as attaining knowledge of unity through the scirptures and as still being subject to the continuation of the stultified experiences Such a position would stand in contradiction to the Sruti and the Smrti: 'He who is allcomprehender' (Mun U ); all knower and supreme and natural power of varied types are spoken of in Srutis such as knowledge strength and action' (Sve U ); 'I know Arjuna all beings of the past present and future but no one knows Me' etc (Gita ) And again if the perception of difference and distinction are said to persist even after the unitary Self has been decisively understood the estion will arise to whom will the Lord and the succession of teachers of the tradition impart the knowledge in accordance with their understanding? The estion needs an answer The idea is that knowledge of nonduality and perception of differences cannot coexist If it be replied by Advaitins holding the BimbaPratibimba (the original and reflections) theory that teachers give instructions to their own reflections in the form of disciples such as Arjuna it would amount to an absurdity For no one who is not out of his senses would undertake to give any instruction to his own reflections in mediums such as a precious stone the blade of a sword or a mirror knowing as he does that they are nondifferent from himself The theory of the persistence of the sublated is thus impossible to maintain as the knowledge of the unitary self destroys the beginningless ignorance in which differences falling outside the self are supposed to be rooted 'The persistence of the sublated' does occur in cases such as the vision of the two moons where the cause of the vision is the result of some real defect in eyesight nor removable by the right understanding of the singleness of the moon Even though the perception of the two moons may continue the sublated cognition is rendered inconseential on the strength of strong contrary evidence For it will not lead to any activity appropriate for a real experience But in the present context (ie the Advaitic) the conception of difference whose object and cause are admittedly unreal is cancelled by the knowledge of reality So the 'persistence of the sublated' can in no way happen Thus if the Supreme Lord and the present succession of preceptors have attained the understanding of (Nondual) reality their perception of difference and work such as teaching proceeding from that perception are impossible If on the other hand the perception of difference persists because of the continuance of ignorance and its cause then these teachers are themselves ignorant of the truth and they will be incapable of teaching the truth Further as the preceptor has attained the knowledge of the unitary self and thery the ignorance concerning Brahman and all the effects of such ignorance are thus annihilated there is no purpose in instructing the disciple It it is held that the preceptor and his knowledge are just in the imagination of the disciple the disciple and his knowledge are similarly the product of the imagination of the preceptor and as such can not put an end to the ignorance in estion If it is maintained that the disciple's knowledge destroys ignorance etc because it contradicts the antecedent state of nonenlightenment the same can be asserted of the preceptor's knowledge The futility of such teachings is obvious Enough of these unsound doctrines which have all been refuted

But the touches with the matras cause the [feelings of] cold and heat pleasure and pain; they are of the nature of coming and going and are transient Forbear them O Descendent of Bharata !,The contact of senses with their objects O Arjuna gives rise to feelings of cold and heat pleasure and pain They come and go never lasing long Endure them O Arjuna,But the contacts of the organs with the objects are the producers of cold and heat happiness and sorrow They have a beginning and an end (and) are transient Bear them O descendant of Bharata,,Matra etc But the unwise lament even over those passing situations of cold and heat pleasure and pain that are created by those touches ie the contacts of the senseobjectsreferable with the term matra with the Soul through the door of the senseorgans; but the wise do not do so Thus says [the Lord] Or the passage may be interpreted as : The touches (contacts) of these objects are with the matras ie with the senseorgans and not directly with the Supreme Self Coming : birth Going : destruction Those situations that have these two you must forbear ie put up with,,,,,,'In the case of a man who knows that the Self is eternal although there is no possibility of delusion concerning the destruction of the Self still delusion as of ordinary people caused by the experience of cold heat happiness and sorrow is noticed in him Delusion arises from being deprived of happiness and sorrow arises from contact with pain etc' apprehending this kind of a talk from Arjuna the Lord said 'But the contacts of the organs' etc Matrasparsah the contacts of the organs with objects; are sitausnasukhaduhkhadah producers of cold heat happiness and sorrow Matrah means those by which are marked off (measured up) sounds etc ie the organs of hearing etc The sparsah contacts of the organs with sound etc are matrasparsah Or sparsah means those which are contacted ie objects viz sound etc Matrasparsah the organs and objects are the producers of cold heat happiness and sorrow Cold sometimes produces pleasure and sometimes pain Similarly the nature of heat too is unpredictable On the other hand happiness and sorrow have definite natures since they do not change Hence they are mentioned separately from cold and heat Since they the organs the contacts etc agamapayinah have a beginning and an end are by nature subject to origination and destruction; therefore they are anityah transient Hence titiksasva bear; tan them cold heart etc ie do not be happy or sorry with regard to them,,,As sound touch form taste and smell with their bases are the effects of subtle elements (Tanmatras) they are called Matras The contact with these through the ear and other senses gives rise to feelings of pleasure and pain in the form of heat and cold softness and hardness The words 'cold and heat' illustrate other sensations too Endure these with courage till you have discharged your duties as prescribed by the scriptures The brave must endure them patiently as they 'come and go' They are transient When the Karmas which cause bondage are destroyed this 'coming and going' will end The Lord now explains the purpose of this endurance:

That wise person becomes immortal whom these (situations) do not trouble and to whom the pleasure and pain are eal,For he whom these do not affect O chief of men and to whom pain and pleasure are the same that steadfast man alone is worthy of immortality,O (Arjuna who are) foremost among men verily the person whom these do not torment the wise man to whom sorrow and happhiness are the same he is fit for Immortality,,But because all these different situations are of the nature of coming and going on that account itself are they not to be lamented on ? It is not so As for instance : What is this which is termed 'coming' ? If it is 'birth' what is that 'birth' itself ? It is wrong to say that is the same as gaining the self by what is nonexistent For to be of the nature of nonexistence is indeed to be devoid of every inherent nature and to be devoid of the very self If a thing is devoid of the self and devoid of every nature how is it possible to convert it into what has an intrinsic nature ? Surely it is impossible to convert the nonblue into blue For it is faulty and undesirable to covert the nonblue into blue For it is faulty and undesirable to conclude that a thing with certain in nature changes to be of a different nature Hence the scritpure goes 'The intrinsic nature of beings would not cease to exist eg the heat of the sun' On the other hand if the 'birth' signifies the gaining of self just by what [really] exists even then why the lamentability on its coming ? For what has gained a self could never be nonexistent and conseently it would be eternal Likewise is the act of 'going' also meant for the existent or the nonexistent ? What is nonexistent is just nonexistent [for ever] How can there be a nonexistencenature even in the case of that which is of the existencenature ? If it is said that it is of the nonexistencenature in the second moment; [since its birth] then it should be so even in the first moment; and so nothing would be existent For the intrinsic nature [ever] remains unabandoned But is it not that the destruction of it (ie of a given thing like a pot) is brought about by the stroke of a hammer etc? Yet if that destruction is altogether different [from the existent one ie the pot] then what does it matter for what is existent ? But it is not be seen [at that time] ? Yet what is actually existent (pot) may not be seen just as when it is covered with a cloth; but it has not turned to be altogether different In fact it has been said [in the scriptures] that this is not different [from the existent] Summarising all these [the Lord] says,,,,,,What will happen to one who bears cold and heat? Listen: Verily the person৷৷'etc (O Arjuna) hi verily; yam purusam the person whom; ete these cold and heat mentioned above; na do not; vyathayanti torment do not perturb; dhiram the wise man; samaduhkhasukham to whom sorrow and happiness are the same who is free from happiness and sorrow when subjected to pleasure and pain because of his realization of the enternal Self; sah he who is established in the realization of the enternal Self who forbears the opposites; kalpate becomes fit; amrtattvaya for Immortality for the state of Immortality ie for Liberation,,,That person endowed with courage who considers pain as inevitable as pleasure and who performs war and such other acts suited to his station in life without attachment to the results and only as a means of attaining immortality one whom the impact of weapons in war etc which involve soft or harsh contacts do not trouble that person only attains immortality not a person like you who cannnot bear grief As the selves are immortal what is to be done here is this much only This is the meaning Because of the immortality of the selves and the natural destructibility of the bodies there is no cause for grief It was told (previously): 'The wise grieve neither for the dead nor for the living' ( ) Now the Lord elucidates the same view

This Soul is of unchanging nature and [hence] is destructions' (the Br U IV v ) Of These two : of what is existent and what is nonexistent Finality : the point of boundary where they come to an end But is this permanent or transient which is perceived by persons who are prone to see the truth ? Having raised this doubt [the Lord] says :,,,,,,Since 'the unreal has no being' etc for this reason also it is proper to bear cold heat etc without becoming sorrowful or deluded Asatah of the unreal of cold heat etc together with their causes; na vidyate there is no; bhavah being existence reality; because heat cold etc together with their causes are not substantially real when tested by means of proof For they are changeful and whatever is changeful is inconstant As configurations like pot etc are unreal since they are not perceived to be different from earth when tested by the eyes so also are all changeful things unreal because they are not perceived to be different from their (material) causes and also because they are not perceived before (their) origination and after destruction Objection: If it be that [Here Ast has the additional words 'karyasya ghatadeh the effect viz pot etc (and)'Tr] such (material) causes as earth etc as also their causes are unreal since they are not perceived differently from their causes in that case may it not be urged that owing to the nonexistence of those (causes) there will arise the contingency of everything becoming unreal [An entity cannot be said to be unreal merely because it is nondifferent from its cause Were it to be asserted as being unreal then the cause also should be unreal because there is no entity which is not subject to the law of cuase and effect]? Vedantin: No for in all cases there is the experience of two awarenesses viz the awareness of reality and the awareness of unreality [In all cases of perception two awarenesses are involved: one is invariable and the other is variable Since the variable is imagined on the invariable therefore it is proved that there is something which is the substratum of all imagination and which is neither a cause nor an effect] That in relation to which the awareness does not change is real; that in relation to which it changes is unreal Thus since the distinction between the real and the unreal is dependent on awareness therefore in all cases (of empirical experiences) everyone has two kinds of awarenesses with regard to the same substratum: (As for instance the experiences) 'The pot is real' 'The cloth is real' 'The elephant is real' (which experiences) are not like (that of) 'A blue lotus' [In the empirical experience 'A blue lotus' there are two awarenesses concerned with two entities viz the substance (lotus) and the ality (blueness) In the case of the experience 'The pot is real' etc the awarenesses are not concerned with substratum and alities but the awareness of potof cloth etc are superimposed on the awareness of 'reality' like that of 'water' in a mirage] This is how it happens everywhere [The coexistence of 'reality' and 'pot' etc are valid only empirically according to the nondualists; whereas the coexistence of 'blueness' and 'lotus' is real according to the dualists] Of these two awareness the awareness of pot etc is inconstant; and thus has it been shown above But the awareness of reality is not (inconstant) Therefore the object of the awareness of pot etc is unreal because of inconstancy; but not so the object of the awareness of reality because of its constancy Objection: If it be argued that since the awareness of pot also changes when the pot is destroyed therefore the awareness of the pot's reality is also changeful? Vedantin: No because in cloth etc the awareness of reality is seen to persist That awareness relates to the odjective (and not to the noun 'pot') For this reason also it is not destroyed [This last sentence has been cited in the fn of AATr] Objection: If it be argued that like the awareness of reality the awareness of a pot also persists in other pots? Vedantin: No because that (awareness of pot) is not present in (the awareness of) a cloth etc Objection: May it not be that even the awareness of reality is not present in relation to a pot that has been destroyed? Vedantin: No because the noun is absent (there) Since the awareness of reality corresponds to the adjective (ie it is used adjectivelly) therefore when the noun is missing there is no possibility of its (that awareness) being an adjective So to what should it relate? But again the awareness of reality (does not cease) with the absence of an object৷৷ [Even when a pot is absent and the awareness of reality does not arise with regare to it the awareness of reality persists in the region where the pot had existed Some read nanu in place of na tu ('But again') In that case the first portion (No৷৷since৷৷adjective So৷৷relate?) is a statement of the Vedantin and the Objection starts from nanu punah sadbuddheh etc so the next Objection will run thus: 'May it not be said that when nouns like pot etc are absent the awareness of existence has no noun to alify and therefore it becomes impossible for it (the awareness of existence) to exist in the same substratum?'Tr] Objection: May it not be said that when nouns like pot etc are absent (the awareness of existence has no noun to alify and therefore) it becomes impossible for it to exist in the same substratum? [The relationship of an adjective and a noun is seen between two real entities Therefore if the relationship between 'pot' and 'reality' be the same as between a noun and an adjective then both of them will be real entities So the coexistence of reality with a nonpot does not stand to reason] Vedantin: No because in such experiences as 'This water exists' (which arises on seeing a mirage etc) it is observed that there is a coexistence of two objects though one of them is nonexistent Therefore asatah of the unreal viz body etc and the dualities (heat cold etc) together with their causes; na vidyate there is no; bhavah being And similarly satah of the real of the Self; na vidyate there is no; abhavah nonexistence because It is constant everywhere This is what we have said Tu but; antah the nature the conclusion (regarding the nature of the real and the unreal) that the Real is verily real and the unreal is verily unreal; ubhayoh api of both these indeed of the Self and the nonSelf of the Real and the unreal as explained above; drstah has been realized thus; tattvadarsibhih by the seers of Truth Tat is a pronoun (Sarvanama lit name of all) which can be used with regard to all And all is Brahman And Its name is tat The abstraction of tat is tattva the true nature of Brahman Those who are apt to realize this are tattvadarsinah seers of Truth Therefore you too by adopting the vision of the men of realization and giving up sorrow and delusion forbear the dualities heat cold etc some of which are definite in their nature and others inconstant mentally being convinced that this (phenomenal world) is changeful verily unreal and appears falsely like water in a mirage This is the idea What again is that reality which remains verily as the Real and surely for ever? This is being answered in 'But know That' etc,,,'The unreal' that is the body can never come into being 'The real' that is the self can never cease to be The finale about these the body and the self which can be experienced has been realised correctly by the seers of the Truth As analyis ends in conclusion the term 'finale' is here used The meaning is this: Nonexistence (ie perishableness) is the real nature of the body which is in itself insentient Existence (ie imperishableness) is the real nature of the self which is sentient [What follows is the justification of describing the body as 'unreal' and as having 'never come into being'] Nonexistence has indeed the nature of perishableness and existence has the nature of imperishableness as Bhagavan Parasara has said: 'O Brahmana apart from conscious entity there does not exist any group of things anywhere and at any time Thus have I taught you what is real existence how conscious entity is real and all else is unreal' (V P ) 'The Supreme Reality is considered as imperishable by the wise There is no doubt that what can be obtained from a perishable substance is also perishable' (Ibid ) 'That entity which even by a change in time cannot come to possess a difference through modification etc is real What is that entity O King? (It is the self who retains Its knowledge)' (Ibid ) It is said here also: 'These bodies ৷৷ are said to have an end' () and 'Know That (the Atman) to be indestructible' () It is seen from this that this (ie perishableness of the body and imperishableness of the self) is the reason for the designating the Atman as 'existence' (Sattva) and body as 'nonexistence' (Asvattva) This verse has no reference to the doctrine of Satkaryavada (ie the theory that effects are present in the cause) as such a theory has no relevance here Arjuna is deluded about the true nature of the body and the self; so what ought to be taught to him in order to remove his delusion is discrimination between these two what is alified by perishablenss and what by imperishableness This (declaration) is introduced in the following way: 'For the dead or for the living' () Again this poin is made clear immediately (by the words) 'Know that to be indestructible ৷৷' () and 'These bodies ৷৷ are said to have an end' () How the imperishableness of the self is to be understood Sri Krsna now teaches:

(that) yena by which by which Brahman called Reality; sarvam all; idam this the Universe together with space; is tatam pervaded as pot etc are pervaded by space Na kascit none; arhati can; kartum bring about; vinasam the destruction disappearance nonexistence; asya of this avyayasya of the Immutable that which does not undergo growth and depletion By Its very nature this Brahman called Reality does not suffer mutation because unlike bodies etc It has no limbs; nor (does It suffer mutation) by (loss of something) belonging to It because It has nothing that is Its own Brahman surely does not suffer loss like Devadatta suffering from loss of wealth Therefore no one can bring about the destruction of this immutable Brahman No one not even God Himself can destroy his own Self because the Self is Brahman Besides action with regard to one's Self is selfcontradictory Which again is that 'unreal' that is said to change its own nature? This is being answered:,,,Know that the self in its essential nature is imperishable The whole of insentient matter which is different (from the self) is pervaded by the self Because of pervasiveness and extreme subtlety the self cannot be destroyed; for every entity other than the self is capable of being pervaded by the self and hence they are grosser than It Destructive agents like weapons water wind fire etc pervade the substances to be destroyed and disintegrate them Even hammers and such other instruments rouse wind through violent contact with the objects and thery destroy their objects So the essential nature of the self being subtler than anything else It is imperishable (The Lord) now says that the bodies are perishable:

Vedantin: No because the Self is selfevident For (only) when the Self stands predetermined as the knower there is a search for a means of knolwedge by the knower Indeed it is not that without first determining oneself as 'I am such' one takes up the task of determining an object of knowledge For what is called the 'self' does not remain unknown to anyone But the scripture is the final authority [when the Vedic text establishes Brahman as the innermost Self all the distinctions such as knower known and the means of knowledge become sublated Thus it is reasonable that the Vedic text should be the final authority Besides its authority is derived from its being faultless in as much as it has not originated from any human being]: By way of merely negating superimposition of alities that do not belong to the Self it attains authoritativeness with regard to the Self but not by virtue of making some unknown thing known There is an Upanisadic text in support of this: '৷৷the Brahman that is immediate and direct the Self that is within all' (Br ) Since the Self is thus eternal and unchanging tasmat therefore; yudhyasva you join the battle ie do not desist from the war Here there is no injunction to take up war as a duty because be (Arjuna) though he was determined for war remains silent as a result of being overpowered by sorrow and delusion Therefore all that is being done by the Lord is the removal of the obstruction to his duty 'Therefore join the battle' is only an approval not an injunction The scripture Gita is intended for eradicating sorrow delusion etc which are the cases of the cycle of births and deaths; it is not intended to enjoin action As evidences of this idea the Lord cites two Vedic verses: [Ka There are slight verbal differencesTr],,,The root 'dih' means 'to grow' Hence these bodies (Dehas) are characterised by complexity They have an end their nature is perishablity For jugs and such other things which are characterised by complexity are seen to have an end The bodies of the embodied self which are made of conglomerated elements serve the purpose of experiencing the effects of Karmas as stated in Brh U IV 'Auspicious embodiments are got through good actions' Such bodies perish when Karmas are exhausted Further the self is imperishable Why? Because it is not measurable Neither can It be conceived as the object of knowledge but only as the subject (knower) It will be taught later on: 'He who knows It is called the knower of the Field by those who know this () Besides the self is not seen to be made up of many (elements) Because in the perception 'I am the knower' throughout the body only something other than the body is understood as possessing an invariable form as the knower Further this knower cannot be dismembered and seen in different places as is the case with the body Therefore the self is eternal for () It is not a complex being of a single form; () It is the knowing subject; and () It pervades all On the contrary the body is perishable because () it is complex; () it serves the purpose of experiencing the fruits of Karma by the embodied self; () it has a plurality of parts and () it can be pervaded Therefore as the body is by nature perishable and the self by nature is eternal both are not objects fit for grief Hence bearing with courage the inevitable strike of weapons sharp or hard liable to be received by you and others begin the action called war without being attached to the fruits but for the sake of attaining immortality

even when sarire the body; hanyamane is killed transformed The verb 'to kill' has to be understood here in the sense of transformation so that a tautology [This verse has already mentioned 'death' in the first line If the verb han to kill is also taken in the sense of killing then a tautology is unavoidableTr] may be avoided In this mantra the six kinds of transformations the material changes seen in the world are denied in the Self The meaning of the sentence is that the Self is devoid of all kinds of changes Since this is so therefore 'both of them do not know' this is how the present mantra is connected to the earlier mantra,,,As the self is eternal for the reasons mentioned (above) and hence free from modifications it is said that all the attributes of the insentient (body) like birth death etc never touch the self In this connection as the statement 'It is never born It never dies' is in the present tense it should be understood that the birth and death which are experienced by all in all bodies do not touch the self The statement 'Having come into being once It never ceases to be' means that this self having emerged at the beginning of a Kalpa (one aeon of manifestation) will not cease to be at the end of the Kalpa (ie will emerge again at the beginning of the next Kalpa unless It is liberated) This is the meaning that birth at the beginning of a Kalpa in bodies such as those of Brahman and others and death at the end of a Kalpa as stated in the scriptures do not touch the self Hence the selves in all bodies are unborn and therefore eternal It is abiding not connected like matter with invisible modifications taking place It is primeval; the meaning is that It existed from time immemorial; It is even new ie It is capable of being experienced always as fresh Therefore when the body is slain the self is not slain

The intention is to deny both (the acts) by saying 'In no way does he kill any one nor does he cause anyone to be killed' because an interrogative sense is absurd (here) Since the implication of the reason [The reason for the denial of killing etc is the changelessness of the Self and this reason holds good with regard to all actions of the man of realizationTr] viz the immutability of the Self [The AA omits 'viz the immutability of the Self'Tr] is common (with regard to all actions) therefore the negation of all kinds of actions in the case of a man of realization is what the Lord conveys as the only purport of this context But the denial of (the act of) killing has been cited by way of an example Objection: By noticing what special reason for the impossibility of actions in the case of the man of realization does the Lord deny all actions (in his case) by saying 'How can that person' etc? Vedantin: Has not the immutability of the Self been already stated as the reason [Some readings omit this wordTr] the specific ground for the impossibility of all actions? Objection: It is true that it has been stated; but that is not a specific ground for the man of realization is different from the immutable Self Indeed may it not be argued that action does not become impossible for one who has known as unchanging stump of a tree?! Vedantin: No because of man of Knowledge is one with the Self Enlightenment does not belong to the aggregate of body and senses Therefore as the last laternative the knower is the Immutable and is the Self which is not a part of the aggregate Thus action being impossible for that man of Knowledge the denial in 'How can that person৷৷' etc is reasonable As on account of the lack of knowledge of the distinction between the Self and the modifications of the intellect the Self though verily immutable is imagined through ignorance to be the perceiver of objects like sound etc presented by the intellect etc in this very way the Self which in reality is immutable is said to be the 'knower' because of Its association with the knowledge of the distinction between the Self and nonSelf which (knowledge) is a modification of the intellect [By buddhivrtti modification of the intellect is meant the transformation of the internal organ into the form of an extension upto an object along with its past impressions the senses concerned etc like the extension of the light of a lamp illuminating an object Consciousness reflected on this transformation and remaining indistinguishable from that transformation revealing the object is called objective knowledge Thery due to ignorance the Self is imagined to be the perceiver because of Its connection with the vrtti modification (AG) The process is elsewhere described as follows: The vrtti goes out through the senseorgan concerned like the flash of a torchlight and along with it goes the reflection of Consciousness Both of them envelop the object a pot for instance The vrtti destroys the ignorance about the pot; and the reflection of Consciousness becoming unified with only that portion of it which has been delimited by the pot reveals the pot In the case of knowledge of Brahman it is admitted that the vrtti in the form 'I am Brahman' does reach Brahman and destroys ignorance about Brahman but it is not admitted that Brahman is revealed like a 'pot' for Brahman is selfeffulgentTr] and is unreal by nature From the statement that action is impossible for man of realization it is understood that the conclusion of the Lord is that actions enjoined by the scriptures are prescribed for the unenlightened Objection: Is not elightenment too enjoined for the ignorant? For the injunction about enlightenment to one who has already achieved realization is useless like grinding something that has already been ground! This being so the distinction that rites and duties are enjoined for the unenlightened and not for the enlightened one does not stand to reason Vedantin: No There can reasonable be a distinction between the existence or nonexistence of a thing to be performed As after the knowledge of the meaning of the injunction for rites like Agnihotra etc their performance becomes bligatory on the unenlightened one who thinks 'Agnihotra etc has to be performed by collecting various accessories; I am the agent and this is my duty' unlike this nothing remains later on to be performed as a duty after knowing the meaning of the injunction about the nature of the Self from such texts as 'Never is this One born' etc But apart from the rise of knowledge regarding the unity of the Self his nonagency etc in the form 'I am not the agent I am not the enjoyer' etc no other idea arises Thus this distinction can be maintained Again for anyone who knows himself as 'I am the agent' there will necessarily arise the idea 'This is my duty' In relation to that he becomes eligible In this way duties are (enjoined) [Ast adds 'sambhavanti become possible'Tr] for him And according to the text 'both of them do not know' () he is an unenlightened man And the text 'How can that person' etc concerns the enlightened person distinguished above becuase of the negation of action (in this text) Therefore the enlightened person distinguished above who has realized the immutable Self and the seeker of Liberation are alified only for renunciation of all rites and duties Therefore indeed the Lord Narayana making a distinction between the enlightened man of Knowledge and the unenlightened man of rites and duties makes them take up the two kinds of adherences in the text 'through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization; through the Yoga of Action for the yogis' () Similarly also Vyasa said to his son 'Now there are these two paths' etc ['Now there are these two paths on which the Vedas are based They are thought of as the dharma characterized by engagement in duties and that by renunciation of them' (Mbh Sa )Tr] So also (there is a Vedic text meaning): 'The path of rites and duties indeed is the earlier and renunciation comes after that' [Ast says that this is not a otation but only gives the purport of Tai Ar Tr] The Lord will show again and again this very division: 'The unenlightened man who is deluded by egoism thinks thus: ""I am the doer""; but the one who is a knower of the facts (about the varieties of the gunas) thinks ""I do not act""' (cf ) So also there is the text '(The embodied man of selfcontrol) having given up all actions mentally continues (happily in the town of nine gates)' () etc With regard to this some wiseacres say: In no person does arise the idea 'I am the changeless actionless Self which is One and devoid of the six kinds of changes beginning with birth to which all things are subject' on the occurrence of which (idea alone) can renunciation of all actions be enjoined That is not correct because it will lead to the needlessness of such scriptural instructions as 'Never is this One born' etc () They should be asked: As on the authority of scripural instructions there arises the knowledge of the existence of virtue and vice and the knowledge regarding an agent who gets associated with successive bodies similarly why should not there arise from the scriptures the knowledge of unchangeability nonagentship oneness etc of that very Self? Objection: If it be said that this is due to Its being beyond the scope of any means (of knowledge)? Vedantin: No because the Sruti says 'It is to be realized through the mind alone (following the instruction of the teacher)' (Br ) The mind that is purified by the instructions of the scriptures and the teacher control of the body and organs etc becomes the instrument for realizing the Self Again since there exist inference and scriptures for Its realization it is mere bravado to say that Knowledge does not arise And it has to be granted that when knowledge arises it surely eliminates ignorance its opposite And that ignorance has been shown in 'I am the killer' 'I am killed' and 'both of them do not know' (see ) And here also it is shown that the idea of the Self being an agent the object of an action or an indirect agent is the result of ignorance Also the Self being changeless the fact that such agentship etc are cuased by ignorance is a common factor in all actions without exception because only that agent who is subject to change instigates someone else who is different from himself and can be acted on saying 'Do this' Thus with a view to pointing out the absence of fitness for rites and duties in the case of an enlightened person the Lord [Ast adds vasudeva after 'Lord'Tr] says 'He who knows this One as indestructible' 'how can that person' etc thery denying this direct and indirect agentship of an enlightened person in respect of all actions without exception As regards the estion 'For what again is the man of enlightenment alified?' the answer has already been give earlier in 'through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization' () Similarly the Lord will also speak of renunication of all actions in 'having given up all actions mentally' etc() Objection: May it not be argued that from the expression 'mentally' (it follows that) oral and bodily actions are not to be renounced? Vedantin: No because of the categoric expression 'all actions' Objection: May it not be argued that 'all actions' relates only to those of the mind? Vedantin: No because all oral and bodily actions are preceded by those of the mind for those actions are impossible in the absence of mental activity Objection: May it not be said that one has to mentally renounce all other activities except the mental functions which are the causes of scriptural rites and duties performed through speech and body? Vedantin: No because it has been specifically expressed: 'without doing or causing (others) to do anything at all' () Objection: May it not be that this renunciation of all actions as stated by the Lord is with regard to a dying man not one living? Vedantin: No because (in that case) the specific statement 'The embodied man৷৷continues happily in the town of nine gates' (ibid) will become illogical since it is not possible for a dead person who neither acts nor makes others act [The words 'akurvatah akarayatah (of him) who neither acts nor makes others act' have been taken as a part of the Commentator's arguement But AG points out that they can also form a part of the next Objection In that case the translation of the Objection will be this: Can it not be that the construction of the sentence (under discussion) is Neither doing nor making others do he rest by depositing (sannyasya by renouncing) in the body' but not 'he rests in the body by renouncing৷৷'?] to rest in that body after renouncing all actions Objection: Can it not be that the construction of the sentence (under discussion) is '(he rests) by depositing (sannyasya by renouncing) in the body' (but) not 'he rests in the body by renouncing৷৷'? Vedantin: No because everywhere it is categorically asserted that the Self is changeless Besides the action of 'resting' reires a location whereas renunciation is independent of this The word nyasa preceded by sam here means 'renunciation' not 'depositing' Therefore according to this Scripture viz the Gita the man of realization is eligible for renunciation alone not for rites and duties This we shall show in the relevant texts later on in the cotext of the knowledge of the Self And now we shall speak of the matter on hand: As to that the indestructibility [Indestructibility suggests unchangeability as well] of the Self has been postulated What is it like? That is being said in 'As after rejecting wornout clothes' etc",,,He who knows the self to be eternal as It is indestructible unborn and changeless how can that person be said to cause the death of the self be it of the self existing in the bodies of gods or animals or immovables? Whom does he kill? The meaning is how can he destroy any one or cause anyone to slay? How does he become an instrument for slaying? The meaning is this: the feeling of sorrow: 'I cause the slaying of these selves I slay these' has its basis solely in ignorance about the true nature of the self Let it be granted that what is done is only separation of the bodies from the eternal selves Even then when the bodies which are instruments for the experience of agreeable pleasures perish there still exists reason for sorrow in their separation from the bodies To this (Sri Krsna) replies:

(Mbh St ) Ka what; paridevana lamentation or what prattle can there be; tatra with regard to them ie with regard to beings which are objects of delusion which are invisible (become) visible (and then) get destroyed!,,,Human beings etc (ie bodies) exist as entities; their previous stages are unknown their middle stages in the form of man etc are known and their (final) and future stages are unknown As they thus exist in their own natural stages there is no cause for grief After thus saying that there is no cause for grief even according to the view which identifies the body with the self Sri Krsna proceeds to say that it is hard to find one who can be said to have truly perceived the Atman or spoken about It or heard about It or gained a true conception of It by hearing For the Atman which is actually different from the body is of a wonderful nature

The knowledge in the form of determination is just one; [but] the knowledge (thoughts) of those who do not have determination has many branches and has no end,In this (Karma Yoga) O Arjuna the resolute mind is onepointed; the minds of the irresolute are manybranched and endless,O scion of the Kuru dynasty in this there is a single onepointed conviction The thoughts of the irresolute ones have many branches indeed and are innumerable,,Vyavasayatmika etc The knowledge in the form of determination is just one and natural in the case of everyone; but it suffers manifoldedness according to the objects to be determined Therefore,,,,,,Kurunandana O scion of the Kuru dynasty; iha is this path to Liberation; there is only eka a single; vyavasayatmika onepointed; buddhih conviction which has been spoken of in the Yoga of Knowledge and which has the characteristics going to be spoken of in (Karma) yoga It is resolute by nature and annuls the numerous branches of the other opposite thoughts since it originates from the right source of knowledge [The right source of knowledge viz the Vedic texts which are above criticism] Those again which are the other buddhayah thoughts; they are bahusakhah possessed of numerous branches ie possessed of numerous variations Owing to the influence of their many branches the worldly state becomes endless limitless unceasing evergrowing and extensive [Endless because it does not cease till the rixe of full enlightenment; limitless because the worldly state which is an effect springs from an unreal source] But even the worldly state ceases with the cessation of the infinite branches of thoughts under the influence of discriminating wisdom arising from the valid source of knowledge (And those thoughts are) hi indeed; anantah innumerable under every branch Whose thoughts? Avyavasayinam of the irresolute ones ie of those who are devoid of discriminating wisdom arising from the right source of knowledg,,,Here ie in every ritual sanctioned by the scriptures the Buddhi or disposition of mind marked by resolution is single The Buddhi marked by resolution is the Buddhi concerned with acts which must be performed by one desirous of release (and not any kind of work) The term 'Vyavasaya' menas unshakable conviction: this Buddhi (disposition of mind) comes out of prior determination about the true nature of the self But the Buddhi concerning the performance of rituals of fulfill certain desires is marked by irresolution; because here only this much knowledge of the self is sufficient 'the self (as an entity) exists differently from the body' Such a general understanding is sufficient to alify for performing acts giving fulfilment of certain desires It does not reire any definite knowledge about the true nature of the self For even if there is no such knowledge desires for heaven etc can arise the means for their attainment can be adopted and the experience of those fruits can take place For this reason there is no contradiction in the teaching of the scriptures [The contradiction negated here is how can the same scriptural acts produce different results fulfilment of desires and liberation The difference in the disposition of the mind accouts of it] The Buddhi (mental disposition) marked by resolution has a single aim because it relates to the attainment of a single fruit For as far as one desiring release is concerned all acts are enjoined only for the accomplishment of that single fruit Therefore since the purpose of the scriptures here is one only (ie liberation) the Buddhi regarding all rituals taught in the scriptures too is only one as far as liberationseekers are concerned For example the set of six sacrifices beginning with Agneya with all their subsidiary processes (though enjoined in different passages) forms the subject of a single injunction as they are all for the attainment of a single fruit Conseently the Buddhi concerning these is one only The meaning of the verse under discussion must be construed in the same manner But the Buddhi of the irresolute ones who are engaged in rituals for winning such fruits as heaven sons cattle food etc are endless frutis being endless In rituals like Darsapurnamasa (new moon and full moon sacrifice) even though attainment of a single fruit (heaven) is enjoined there accrues to these the character of having many branches on account of the mention of many secondary fruits as evidenced by such passages as 'He desires a long life' Therefore the Buddhi of irresolute ones has many branches and are endless The purport is: In performing obligatory and occasional rituals all fruits primary and secondary promised in the scriptures should be abandoned with the idea that release or salvation is the only purpose of all scriptureordained rituals These rituals should be performed without any thought of selfish gains In addition acts motivated by desires (Kamyakarmas) also should be performed according to one's own capacity after abandoning all desire for fruits and with the conviction that they also when performed in that way form the means for attainment of release They should be looked upon as eal to obligatory and occasional rites suited to one's own station and stage in life Sri Krsna condemns those who perform acts for the attainment of objects of desire:

increase that alone The purport is: do not nurse the preponderance of the three Gunas in their state of intermixture; do not cultivate such preponderance Be free from the pairs of opposites; be free from all the characteristics of worldly life Abide in pure Sattva; be established in Sattva in its state of purity without the admixture of the other two Gunas If it is estioned how that is possible the reply is as follows Never care to acire things nor protect what has been acired While abandoning the acisition of what is not reired for selfrealisation abandon also the conservation of such things already acired You can thus be established in selfcontrol and thery become an aspirant after the essentail nature of the self 'Yoga' is acisition of what has not been acired; 'Ksema' is preservation of things already acired Abandoning these is a must for an aspirant after the essential nature of the self If you conduct yourself in this way the preponderance of Rajas and Tamas will be annihilated and pure Sattva will develop Besides all that is taught in the Vedas is not fit to be utilised by all

The first alternative is untenable because a valid means of knowledge reveals its objects even without an injunction The second alternative also is untenable because the Self is selfrevealing whereas an injunction is possible in the case of something yet to be achieved And one's own Self is not an object of that kind] Surely after the realization of the true nature of the Self there is no scope again for any means to or end of knowledge The last valid means of (Self) knowledge eradicates the possibility of the Self's becoming a perceiver And even as it eradicates it loses its own authoritativeness in the same way as the means of knowledge which is valid in dream becomes unauthoritative during the waking state In the world too after the preception of an abject the valid means of that perception is not seen to be a cause impelling the knower (to any action with regard to that object) Hence it is established that for an knower of the Self there remains no eligibility for rites and duties The attainment of Liberation is only for the sannyasin [Liberation is attained only by one who after aciring an intellectual knowledge of the Self in a general way is endowed with discrimination and detachment has arisen above all desires has become a monk in the primary sense and has directly realized the Self by going through the process of sravana (understanding of Upanisadic texts about the Self) etc] the man of enlightenment who has renounced all desires and is a man of steady wisdom; but not for him who has not renounced and is desirious of the objects (of the senses) Such being the case with a view to establishing this with the help of an illustration the Lord says:,,,That Buddhi (understanding) which has the self for its object is night to all beings ie is obscure like night to all But he who has subdued the senses and is serene is awake in respect of the self The meaning is that he has the vision of the self All beings are awake ie are actively cognisant in respect of objects of the senses like sound But such sense objects are like things enshrouded by night to the sage who is awake to the self

In answer the Lord says: The steadfastness jnanayogena through the Yoga of KnowledgeKnowledge itself being the Yoga [Here jnana Knowledge refers to the knowledge of the supreme Reality and Yoga is used in the derivative sense of 'that (Knowledge) through which one gets united with Brahman']; had been stated sankhyanam for the men of realizationthose possessed of the Knowledge arising from the discrimination with regard to the Self and the notSelf those who have espoused monasticism from the stage of Celibacy; itself those to whom the entity presented by the Vedantic knowledge has become fully ascertained (see Mu )the monks who are known as the paramahamsas those who are established in Brahman alone And the steadfastness karmayogena through the Yoga of Actionaction itself being the Yoga [Yoga here means 'that through which one gets united with comes to have prosperity' ie such actions as go by the name of righteousness and are prescribed by the scriptures] had been stated yoginam for the yogis the men of action (rites and duties) This is the idea Again had it been intended or stated or if it will be stated in the Gita by the Lordand if it has also been so stated in the Vedasthat Knowledge and action are to be practised in combination by one and the same person for attaining the same human Goal why then should He here tell His dear supplicant Arjuna that steadfastness in either Knowledge or action is to be practised only by different persons who are respectively alified? If on the other hand it be supposed that the Lord's idea is 'After hearing about both Knowledge and action Arjuna will himself practise them (in combination); but to others I shall speak of them as being meant to be pursued by different persons' then the Lord would be imagined to be unreliable being possessed of likes and dislikes! And that is untenable So from no point of view whatsoever can there be a combination of Knowledge and action And what has been said by Arjuna regarding superiority of Wisdom over action that stands confirmed for not having been refuted; and (it also stands confirmed) that steadfastness in Knowledge is suitable for being practised by monks alone And from the statement that they (Knowledge and action) are to be followed by different persons it is understood that this has the Lord's approval Noticing that Arjuna had become dejected under the impression 'You are urging me to that very action which is a source of bondage' and was thinking thus 'I shall not undertake action' the Lord said 'Na karmanam anarambhat not by abstaining from action' etc Or:When steadfastness in Knowledge and steadfastness in action become incapable of being pursued simultaneously by one and the same person owing to mutual contradiction then since it may be concluded that they become the cause of attaining the human Goal independently of each other therefore in order to showthat the steadfastness in action is a means to the human Goal not independently but by virtue of being instrumental in securing steadfastness in Knowledge; and that on the other hand steadfastness in Knowledge having come into being through the means of steadfastness in action leads to the human Goal independently without anticipating anything elsethe Lord said:,,,The Lord said You have not properly understood what I taught you before In this world full of people with varying degrees of alifications I have taught in the days of yore two ways that of knowledge (Jnana Yoga) and that of works according to the alifications of aspirants There is no contradiction in this It is not possible for all people of the world in whom the desire for release has arisen to become capable immediately for the practice of Jnana Yoga But he who performs the worship of the Supreme Person without desire for fruits and thery gets completely rid of inner impurities and keeps his senses unagitated he becomes competent for the path of knowledge That all activities are for performing the worship of the Supreme Person will be taught in the Gita verse 'He from `whom the activities of all beings arise and by whom all this is pervaded by worshipping Him with his duty man reaches perfection' () Earlier also performance of activities without any attachment to the fruits is enjoined by the verse beginning with 'You have the right to work alone ৷৷' () Next for those whose intellect has been redeemed by this kind of discipline is enjoined Jnana Yoga by the words 'When a man renounces all the desires ৷৷' () Conseently firm devotion to Jnana Yoga is taught only to the Sankhyas ie those persons who are competent to follow the discipline of the knowledge of the self and Karma Yoga to Yogins ie to those competent for the path of work Sankhya means Buddhi and those who are endowed with the Buddhi (intellectual or mental disposition) having only the self for its object are Sankhyans Therefore those who are not fit for this are alified for Karma Yoga Those who are possessed of Buddhi which is agitated by objects of the senses are the persons alified for Karma Yoga whereas those whose Buddhi is not thus agitated are alified for Jnana Yoga Therefore nothing contradictory and confusing is taught It is said in the next stanza that Jnana Yoga is difficult to practise all at once even when the desire for release arises in any worldy person:

The answer is: Because performing actions is itself a means to freedom from action Indeed there can be no attainment of an end without (its) means And Karmayoga is the means to the Yoga of Knowledge characterized by freedom from action because it has been so established in the Upanisads and here as well As for the Upanisads it has been shown in the texts 'The Brahmanas seek to know It through the study of the Vedas sacrifices (charity and austerity consisting in a dispassionate enjoyment of senseobjects)' (Br ) etc whch deal with the means of realizing the goal of Knowledge under discussion viz the Realm of the Self that the Yoga of Karma is a means to the Yoga of Knowledge And even here (in the Gita) the Lord will established that 'But O mightyarmed one renunciation is hard to attain without (Karma)yoga' (); 'By giving up attachment the yogis undertake work৷৷for the purification of themselves' (); 'Sacrifice charity and austerity are verily the purifiers of the wise' () etc Objection: Is it not that in such texts as'Extending to all creatures immunity from fear' (Na Par ) (one should take recourse to freedom from action) it is shown that attainment of freedom from action follows even from the renunciation of obligatory duties? And in the world too it is a better known fact that freedom from action follows abstention from actions Hence also arises the estion 'Why should one who desires freedom from action undertake action?' Reply: Therefore the Lord said: Na ca nor; samadhigacchati does he attain; siddhim fulfilment steadfastness in the Yoga of Knowledge characterized by freedom from action; sannyasanat eva merely through renunciationeven from the mere renunciation of actions which is devoid of Knowledge What again is the reason that by the mere giving up of actions which is not accompanied with Knowledge a person does not attain fulfulment in the form of freedom from actions? To this ery seeking to know the cause the Lord says:,,,Not by nonperformance of the acts prescribed by the scriptures does a person attain freedom from Karma ie Jnana Yoga; nor by ceasing to perform such actions as are prescribed in the scriptures and are already begun by him For success is achieved by actions done without attachment to the fruits and by way of worshipping the Supreme Person Hence devoid of it (Karmanistha) one does not achieve Jnananistha By those persons who have not worshipped Govinda by acts done without attachment to fruits and whose beginningless and endless accumulation of evil has not been annulled thery constant contemplation on the self is not possible It can be done only if it is preceded by the attainment of a state in which the operation of the senses have been freed from disturbance This view is put forward by the Lord:

The answers this'Tr] viddhi know; that karma action; is brahmodbhavam it has Brahma the Veda as its udbhavam origin [Here Ast adds 'revealer'Tr] Further Brahma called the Veda is aksarasamudbhavam it has aksara the Immutable Brahman the supreme Self as its source This is the meaning Since the Veda came out like the breath of a man from the supreme Self Itself called the Immutable therefore the Veda being the revealer of everything is sarvagatam all pervading Even though allpervading the Veda is nityam for ever; pratisthitam based; yajne on sacrifice because the injunctions about sacrifices predominate in it,,,Here ther term 'Brahman' connotes the physical body consisting of modifications of the Prakrti; for the Prakrti is denoted here by the term 'Brahman' as in the scriptural text: 'From Him arises this Brahman and this 'Brahman' becomes name form and food' (Mun U ) Here also it will be said by Sri Krsna: 'This great 'Brahman' is my womb' () Therefore the words that 'Activity springs from 'Brahman' teaches that activity is produced by the physical body which is of the nature of the modification of Prakrti The 'Brahman' arises from the imperishable self Here the term 'imperishable' indicates the individual self The physical body which is inhabited by the self who is satisfied by food and drink is fit for action; hence the physical body which constitutes the instrument of activity is said to be from the imperishable Therefore the 'allpervading Brahman' means here the bodies of all persons of diverse kinds which are the products of Prakrti which comprises all material entities and is hence allpervading They the bodies are established in sacrifice The meanig is that the bodies have roots in sacrifice

Either anticipating Arjuna's estion to this effect or in order to make the meaning of the scripture (Gita) clearly understood the Lord revealing out of His own accord that the following substance of the UpanisadsBecoming freed from false knowledge by knowing this very Self the Brahmanas renounce what is a compulsory duty for those having false knoweldge viz desire for sons etc and then lead a mendicant life just for the purpose of maintaining the body; they have no duty to perform other than steadfastness in the knowledge of the Self (cf Br )has been presented here in the Gita says:,,,Thus this wheel is set in motion by the Supreme Person: From food arise embodied selves which are denoted by the word 'beings': from rain food; from sacrifice rain; sacrifice from activities which constitute the exercise of an agent; and activity from the embodied self; and again the body endowed with life from food In this manner there is a seence which revolves like a wheel through the mutual relations of cause and effect Hence He who is engaged in spiritual practice whether one is alified for Karma Yoga or Jnana Yoga if he does not follow ie does not keep in motion the wheel which revolves in a circle through mutual relation of cause and effect that person by not maintaining his bodily subsistence by means of the 'remainder of sacrifice' lives in sin His life begins in sin or develops in sin or is of both these kinds; he lives the life of sin Thus he is a reveller in his senses and not in his self The senses become the pleasuregardens of one whose mind and body are not nourished by the 'remainders of sacrifices' Rajas and Tamas preponderate in his body Being thus turned away from the vision of the self he rejoices only in the enjoyment of the senses Therefore even if he were to attempt for the vision of the self it will be fruitless So he lives in vain O Arjuna Sri Krsna now says that there is no need for the performance of the 'great sacrifices' etc according to his station and stage of life only in respect of a liberated person whose vision of the self does not depend on any external means

In reply the Lord says:,,,Do not bewilder the minds of ignorant aspirants by saying that there is besides Karma Yoga another way to the vision of the self They cannot practise Jnana Yoga on account of their incomplete knowledge of the self and attachment to action They are alified for Karma Yoga because of their being fit only for activity on account of the subtle impressions of their beginningless Karma What then follows from this? It is this: Even though one is alified for Jnana Yoga because of the complete knowledge of the self one should do work holding the view as said previously that Karma Yoga by itself without Jnana Yoga is an independent means for the vision of the self He should thus generate love for all types of activity among those who do not know the complete truth Sri Krsna declares (in the verses to ) the way in which the self is to be contemplated on as not being an agent as reired by Karma Yoga after demonstrating the difference between the enlightened and unenlightened among those practising Karma Yoga

As to this the answer is being stated:,,,Those who 'do not know the whole truth' are those persons who are trying for the vision of the self but are deluded about the nature of the self not knowing on account of their involvement in Prakrti that actions proceed from the Gunas of Prakrti They are therefore attached to the actions of the Gunas ie only to actions forming part of Karma Yoga They are alified only for Karma Yoga One who knows the complete truth should not by himself remaining a practitioner of Jnana Yoga unsettle those persons who are ignorant and who do not know the complete truth Those the ignorant who tend to follow the behaviour of a great man when they see him transcend Karma Yoga will have their minds shaken from Karma Yoga Thus the great man should himself remain established in Karma Yoga while having the full knowledge of the true nature of the self and contemplating on the self as not being the agent Thus he should demonstrate that Karma Yoga by itself is an autonomous means for the vision of the self He should create in those who do not know the complete truth the love of Karma Yoga The superiority of this Karma Yoga over Jnana Yoga even for those who are alified for Jnana Yoga has already been stated Therefore one who is a respected person of note should follow this Karma Yoga alone for the good of the world The method of performing actions after attributing agency to the Gunas by discerning the nature of the self as different from Prakrti has been taught The agency of the self is not produced by the inherent nature of the self but by its contact with the Gunas Hence by discriminating between what is obtained by contact and not obtained when there is no contact it has to be understood that this agency is due to the Gunas or Prakrti Now it is said that the agency of works first attributed to Gunas ultimately go to the Supreme Person who is the Self of all It is done by discerning that the nature of the individual self is one of subservience to the Supreme Person as they constitute His body:

That is wrong:,,,An unavoidable attraction has been fixed for organs of sense like ear towards the objects like sound and for organs of action like that of tongue towards their objects like tasty food This longing is in the form of desire to experience these objects which is caused by old subtle impressions When their experience is thwarted an unavoidable aversion is experienced Thus these two attachment and aversion bring under their control one who aspires to follow Jnana Yoga and forcibly engage him in actions appropriate to them in spite of his having established some sort of control over the senses Such an aspirant fails to get the experience of the self and therefore becomes completely lost So no one practising Jnana Yoga should come under the sway of attachment and aversion which are ruinous These two attachment and aversion are indeed his unconerable foes that deter him from the practice of Jnana Yoga

This is being answered:,,,For whatever reason a person engaged in Jnana Yoga which is of the nature of abandoning the activities of all the senses should control this enemy in the shape of desire which turns him away from the self through creating infatuation for objects of the senses for the same reason you who are yoked to the activities of the senses by reason of being in conjunction with the Prakrti should in the beginning itself ie at the very beginning of the practice of the means for release control the senses by the practice of Karma Yoga which provides for the regulation of the working of the senses And then you must destroy ie slay this sinful enemy which is in the shape of desire and which destroys knowledge and discrimination ie knowledge relating to the nature of the self and of the discriminative power which is the means to gain this knowledge Sri Krsna speaks of that which is most important among the adversaries:

Now there is no contradiction here for it was ite possible that He had taught Vivasvan in a former birth The memory of what was done in former births is ite natural for great men This should not be taken to mean that Arjuna does not know the son of Vasudeva the speaker as the Lord of all Because he (Arjuna) says later on: 'You are the Supreme Brahman the Supreme Light and the Supreme Purifier All the seers proclaim You as the eternal Divine Purusa the Primal Lord unborn and allpervading So also proclaim the divine sage Narada Asita Devala and Vyasa You Yourself also are saying this to me' () Arjuna had heard repeatedly from Bhisma and others during the Rajasuya sacrifice of Yudhisthira 'Krsna alone is the cause of creation and submergence of all the worlds This universe consisting of things both animate and inanimate was created for the sake of Krsna' (Ma Bha ) 'The entire universe is subservient to Krsna' is the meaning of 'For the sake of Krnsa' This apparent contradiction may be explained as follows: Arjuna surely knows the son of Vasudeva as the Bhagavan Though knowing Him as such he estions as if he did not know Him This is his intention Can the birth of the Lord of all who is antagonistic to all that is evil and wholly auspicious omniscient whose will is always true and whose desires are fulfilled can the birth of such a Person be of the same nature as that of the gods men etc who are subject to Karma? Or can it be false like the illusions of a magical show? Or could it be real? In other words is the birth of the Supreme Being as the incarnate a real fact or a mere illusory phenomenon produced by a magician's art? If His birth is real what is the mode of His birth? What is the nature of His body? What is the manner of His birth? What is the nature of this body of His? What is the casue of His birth? To what end is He born?

The answer is:,,,Purified by the austerity called knowledge of the truth of My life and deeds many have become transformed in this manner The Sruti says to the same effect: 'The wise know well the manner in which He is born' (Tai A ) 'Dhiras' means the foremost among the wise The meaning is the wise know the manner of His birth thus It is not that I protect only those who resort to Me in incarnations in the shapes of gods men etc

As to that hear the reason for this:,,,Whoever desirous of resorting to Me in whatever manner they think of Me according to their inclinations and take refuge in Me ie resort to Me I favour them in the same manner as desired by them; I reveal Myself to them Why say much here! All men who are intent on following Me do experience with their own eyes and other organs of sense in all ways ie in every way wished by them My form (including images) however inaccessible it might be to speech and thought of the Yogins Now after completing the incidental topic (with regard to divine incarnations) in order to teach the mode in which Karma Yoga itself acires the form of Jnana He begins to speak of the difficulty in finding persons who are alified for Karma Yoga of this kind

Or:It has been said 'Human beings having such divisions as castes stages of life etc follow My path in every way' For what reason again do they as a rule follow Your path alone but not of others? This is being answered:",,,All men desirous of the fruits of their actions 'sacrifice' ie worship or propitiate Indra and other divinities only But nobody worships Me abandoning attachment to fruits Me who am the Self of Indra and other divinities and the real enjoyer of all sacrifices Why is this so? Because in this world of men fruits in the form of sons cattle food etc follow soon from their performance of such sacrificial rites The phrase 'the world of men' implies heaven etc also Because the unending accumulation of evil heaped up from beginningless time has not been exhausted all those worldly people lack discernment Therefore they want rapid results and perform those rituals which consist of the worship of Indra and other divinities for the sake of sons cattle food etc and for the sake of heaven etc But none with his mind anguished by Samsara and aspiring for final release practises Karma Yoga of the kind described above Real Karma Yoga is My worship Sri Krsna now speaks of the cause which annuls the evil obstructing the starting of Karma Yoga

This is at the stage of rising But at the stage of total tranility he injures or cuts all actions Thus he performs all action or performs no action This is the secret and sacred knowledge got by sitting near (by serving) the feet of the preceptors Therefore,,,,,,"Since engagement and nonengagement (in action) depend on an agent therefore yah he who; pasyet ie pasyati finds; akarma inaction absence of action; karmani in actionkarma means whatever is done action in general; in tha action; and yah who; finds karma action; akarmani in inaction in the absence of action; sah he; is buddhiman a wise one; manusyesu among men All dealings involving an act accessories etc exist certainly on the plane of ignorance [Both engagement and nonengagement presuppose agentship and an act of some kind This however holds good on the plane of ignorance but not on that of Selfrealization] only so long as one has not attained to the Reality He is a yogi yuktah engaged in yoga; and a krtsnakarmakrt performer of all actions One who discriminates between action and actions One who discriminates between action and inaction is praised thus Objection: Well what is meant by this contradictory statement 'He who finds inaction in action' and 'action in inaction'? For action cannot become inaction nor inaction action That being so how can a witness have (such) an incongruous perception? Vedantin: Is it not that [Ast reads na in place of nanuTr] to an ordinary foolsih observer that which is reality is inaction appears as action and similarly action itself as inaction? That being so in order to show things as they are the Lord says 'He who finds inaction in action' etc Therefore there is no incongruity Besides the alifications such as 'intelligent' etc (thus) become logical And by saying 'there is something to be known' is implied the perception of things as they are Moreover freedom from evil cannot follow from an erroneous perception; whereas it has been said 'by knowing which you will become free from evil' Therefore one account of action and inaction being perceived contrarily by the creatures the Lord's utterance 'he who finds inaction in action' etc is for dispelling their contrary perception Not that in the empirical plane inaction has action as its receptacle like a plum in a bowl! Nor even has action inaction as its receptacle because inaction is a negation of action Therefore action and inaction are actually perceived contrarily by the ordinary personslike seeing water in a mirage or silver in nacre Objection: Is it not that to every one action is action itself? Never is there an exception to this Vedantin: That is not so becuase when a boat is moving motionless trees on the bank appear to move in the opposite direction to a man on the boat; an absence of motion is noticed in distant moving things which are not near one's eyes Similarly here also occurs the contrary perceptions viz seeing action in inaction under the idea 'I am doing' [Ast omits 'aham karomi iti under the idea ""I am doing""'Tr] and seeing inaction in acionbecause of which it is said 'He who finds inaction in action' etc in order to eliminate them As such although this answer has been given more than once still a man becomes repeatedly deluded under the influence of a totally opposite perception And forgetting the truth that has been heard again and again he repeatedly raises false issues and estions! And therefore observing that the subject is difficult to understand the Lord gives His answer again and again The absence of action in the Selfwellknown from the Vedas Smrtis and logic as stated in '(It is said that) This is unmanifest; This is inconceivable' () 'Never is this One born and never does It die' (; Ka ) etchas been and will be spoken of The contrary perception of action in that actionless Self ie in inaction is very deeprooted owing to which 'even the intelligent are confounded as to what is action and what is inaction' And as a conseence of the superimposition of aciton pertaining to the body etc on the Self there arises such ideas as 'I am an agent; this is my action; its result is to be enjoyed by me' Similarly with the idea 'I shall remain iet whery I shall be free from exertion free from activity and happy' and superimposing on the Self the cessation of activities pertaining to the body and organs and the resulting happiness a man imagines 'I shall not do anything; I shall sit ietly and happily' That being so the Lord says 'he who finds inaction in action' etc with a view to removing this contrary understanding of man And here in this world though action belonging to the body and organs continues to be action still it is superimposed by everyone on the acitonless unchanging Self as a result of which even a learned person things 'I act' Therefore in action (karmani) which is universally considered by all people to be inherent in the Self like the perception of motion in the (stationary) trees on the bank of a river(in that action) he who contrariwise finds the fact of inaction like perceiving absence of motion in those trees And in inaction (akarmani) in the cessation of the activities pertaining to the body and organs and ascribed to the Self in the same way that actions are ascribed in that action he who sees action because of egoism being implicit in the idea 'I am happily seated ietly without doing anything'; he who knows thus the distinction between action and inaction is wise is learned among men; he is engaged in yoga he is a yogi and a performer of all actions And he freed from evil attains fulfilment This is the meaning This verse is interpreted by some in another way How? (Thus:) 'Since the daily obligatory duties (nityakarmas) certainly have no results when performed as a dedication to God therefore in a secondary sense they are said to be inaction Again the nonperformance of these (nityakarmas) is inaction; since this produces an evil result therefore it is called action verily in a figurative sense That being so he who sees inaction in the daily obligatory duties (nityakarmas) owing to the obsence of their resultsin the same way as a cow that does not yield milk is said to be not a cow though in reality it is soso also in the nonperformance of the daily obligatory duties ie in inaction he who sees action since that yields results such as hell etc৷৷' This explanation is not logical because freedom from evil as a result of such knowledge is unreasonable and the utterance of the Lord in the sentence '৷৷by knowing which you will become freed from evil' will be contradicted How? Even if it be that liberation from evil follows from the performance of nityakarmas it cannot however follow from the knowledge of the absence of their results For it has not been enjoined (anywhere) that knowledge of the nityakarmas (themselves) leads to the result of freedom from evil Nor has this been stated here by the Lord Himself Hery is refuted the 'seeing of action in inaction' [As explained by othersTr] for (according to the opponent) 'seeing of action in inaction' has not been enjoined here [Here in the present verse] as a duty but (what has been enjoined is) merely that performance of the nityakarmas is obligatory Moreover no result can accrue from the knowledge that evil arises from nonperformance of nityakramas Nor even has nonperformance of nityakarmas been enjoined as something that should be known Besides such results as freedom from evil wisdom engagement in yoga and being a performer of all actions cannot reasonably follow from a false perception of action as inaction Nor is this a eulogy of false perception [The stated results accrue from correct knowledge not from false perception; and correct knowledge alone is praiseworthy] Indeed false perception is itself an abvious form of evil! How can it bring about liberation from another evil? Surely darkness does not become the remover of darkness! Opponent: Well the seeing of inaction in action or the seeing of action in inactionthat is not a false perception Vadantin: What then? Opponent: It is a figurative statement based on the existence or the nonexistence of results Vedantin: Not so because there is no such scriptural statement that something results from knowing action as inaction and inaction as action even in a figurative sense Besides nothing particular is gained by rejecting what is heard of (in the scriptures) and imagining something that is not Further it was possible (for the Lord) to express in His own words that there is no result from the nityakarmas and that by their nonperformance one would have to go to hell Under such circumstances what was the need of the ambiguous statement 'He who sees inaction in action' etc which is misleading to others? This being the case such an explanation by anyone will be clearly tantamount to imagining that statement of the Lord as meant for deluding people Moreover this subjectmatter (performance of nityakarmas) is not something to be protected with mystifying words It is not even logical to say that the subjectmatter will become easy for comprehension if it is stated again and again through different words For the subjectmatter that was stated more clearly in 'Your right is for action alone' () does not need any repetition And everwhere it is said that whatever is good and ought to be practised deserves to be understood; anything purposeloss does not deserve to be known Besides neither is false knowledge worth aciring nor is the semblance of an object presented by it worth knowing Nor even can any evil which is an entity arise from the nonperformance of nityakarmas which is a nonentity for there is the statement 'Of the unreal there is no being' () and (in the Upanisad) it has been pointed out 'How can existence originate from nonexistence?' (Ch ) Since emergence of the existent from the nonexistent has been denied therefore anyone's assertion that the existent originates from the nonexistent will amount to saying that a nonentity becomes an entity and an entity becomes a nonentity! And that is not rational because it runs counter to all the means of valid knowledge Further the scriptures cannot enjoin fruitless actions they being naturally painful; and it is illogical that what is painful should be done intentionally Also if it is admitted that falling into hell results from their nonperformance (ie of the nityakarmas) then that too is surely a source of evil In either case whether one undertakes them or not the scriptures will be imagined to be useless And there will be a contradiction with your own standpoint when after holding that the nityakarmas are fruitless you assert that they lead to Liberation Therefore the meaning of 'He who finds inaction in action' etc is just what stands out literally And the verse has been explained by us accordingly The aforesaid perception of 'inaction in action' etc is being praised:",,,Here by the term 'nonaction' the knowledge of the self which is distinct from action and which forms the subject under consideration is meant 'He who sees nonaction in action and also action in nonaction' denotes him who can perceive knowledge of the self even while action is being performed and who can also perceive action while engaged in nonaction ie knowledge of the self What is the import of this saying? What is taught here is this: One can perceive by constant contemplation on the truth about the self that the action that is being performed in itself is a form of knowledge One can also perceive that this knowledge is also of the form of Karma because of its being contained in Karma Yoga Both these (ie action in the form of knowledge and knowledge in the form of actions) are accomplished by contemplation on the true nature of the self even while work is being performed Thus he who can see actions as included in contemplation on the reality of the self is wise ie he knows the full meaning of the Sastras; he is fit among men ie fit to attain release He alone has fulfilled all actions ie carried out the entire purpose of the Sastras [The purport is that no contradiction between knowledge and action is felt by one who knows the philosophy of the self] How is the form of knowledge accomplished through works which are obviously activities that are being performed?

His actions verily become 'inaction' because of having been burnt away by the fire of wisdom By way of pointing out this idea the Lord says:,,,In the case of an aspirant for release all undertakings of actions in the form of obligatory occasional and desiderative acts accomplished through the acisition of materials for their performance as also other works are free from desire ie are devoid of attachment to fruits They are devoid of delusive identification If the mind identifies the self with Prakrti and its Gunas it is Sankalpa ie 'delusive identification' Genuine Karma Yoga is free from such identification Such identification is overcome through contemplation on the real nature of the self as different from Prakrti Those who know the truth call him a sage who acts in this way and whose previous Karmas are thery burnt up by the fire of knowledge of the real nature of the self generated along with his actions He is a true Karma Yogin Thus that knowledge is involved in true Karma Yoga is established Sri Krsna elaborates this point again:

Again what does it matter if by (the words) sariram karma is meant 'actions done by the body' or 'actions merely for the purpose of maintaning the body? The answer is: If by sariram karma is meant actions done by the body then it will amount to a contradiction [Contradiction of the scriptures] when the Lord says 'one does not incur sin by doing with his body any action meant for seen or unseen purposes even though it be prohibited' Even if the Lord were to say that 'one does not incur sin by doing with his body some scripturally sanctioned action intended to secure a seen or an unseen end' then there arises the contingency of His denying something (some evil) that has not come into being! (Further) from the specification sariram karma kurvan (by doing actions with the body) and from the use of the word kevala (only) it will amount to saying that one incurs sin by performing actions called righteous and unrighteous which can be accomplished with the mind and speech and which come within the purview of injunction and prohibition Even there the statement that one incurs sin by performing enjoined actions through the mind and speech will involve a contradiction; even in the case of doing what is prohibited it will amount to a mere purposeless restatement of a known fact On the other hand when the sense conveyed by sariram karma is taken as acctions merely for the purpose of maintaining the body then the implication will be that he does not do any other work as can be accomplished physically orally or mentally which are known from injunctions and prohibitions (of the scriptures) and which have in view seen or unseen results; while he appears to people to be working with those very body (speech) etc merely for the purpose of maintaining the body yet he does not incur sin by merely making movements of the body etc because from the use of the word kevala (merely) it follows that he is devoid of the sense of agentship implicit in the idea 'I do' Since there is no possibility of a person who has reached such a state incurring evil as suggest by the word sin therefore he does not become subject to the evil of transmigration That is to say he certainly becomes free without any obstacle since he has all his actions burnt away by the fire of wisdom This verse is only a reiteration of the result of full illumination stated earlier It becomes faultless by accepting the interpretation of sariram karma thus In the case of the monk who has renounced all possessions since owning food etc meant for the bare sustenance of the body is absent therefore it becomes imperative to beg for alms etc for the upkeep of the body Under this circumstance by way of pointing out the means of obtaining food etc for the maintenance of the body of a monk as permitted by the text 'What comes unasked for without forethought and spontaneously৷৷' [Unasked for: what comes before the monk gets ready for going out for alms; without forethought: alms that are not given with abuses and have not fallen on the ground but collected from five or seven houses without any plan; spontaneously: alms brought to one spontaneously by devoted people] (Bo Sm ) etc the Lord says:,,,'Free from desire' means having no attachment to the fruits of actions 'His intellect and mind controlled' means one whose intellect and mind are under control 'Giving up all possessions' means one who on account of his having the self as his primary objective is devoid of the sense of ownership in relation to Prakrti and its derivatives One who is thus engaged in bodily work alone as long as he lives does not incur any sin ie does not get engrossed in Samsara He gets the vision of the self by Karma Yoga of this kind itself and need not resort to any exlusive practice of Jnana Yoga in between liberation and the practice of Karma Yoga of the alone description

This is being answered: Because,,,Of a person whose attachment to all objects is gone because of his mind being established in the knowledge of the self who is therefore liberated from accepting all worldly possessions and who is engaged in the performance of sacrifices etc as described above in the case of such a person his beginningless load of Karma which is the cause of his bondgae is completely dissolved ie destroyed without leaving any residue So far the nature of Karma as having the form of knowledge has been described as emerging from constant contemplation on the nature of the self as different from Prakrti And now Sri Krsna says that all actions together with their ancillaries have the form of knowledge because of constant contemplation by the aspirant on the Supreme Person who is the Supreme Brahman as being his soul

This is the idea here Thus a top secret is furnished by this and by the succeeding verses that has been also detailed by us (Ag) even though our intelligence is limited as far as our intelligence permits by not transgressing the instructions of our preceptors Maybe for a person without a regular course of the oral tradition [of the system] this looks like a picture painted on the sky and does not appeal to his mind On that account we should not be blamed It has been declared by some in this context that [here in this verse] the oblation the fire and the instruments like sruk [used for offering the oblation into the fire in the sacrifice] and also the act [of offering] are all adjectives alifying the Brahmam This [explanation] deserves to be ignored For these commentators have not troden on the path of the secret tradition,,,,,,"Brahmaarpanam the ladle is Brahman: The knower of Brahman perceives the instrument with which he offers oblation in the fire as Brahman Itself He perceives it as not existing separately from the Self as one sees the nonexistence of silver in nacre In this sense it is that Brahman Itself is the ladlejust as what appears as silver is only narcre (The two words brahma and arpanam are not parts of a compound word samasa) The meaning is that to a knower of Brahman what is perceived in the world as ladle is Brahman Itself Similarly brahmahavih the oblations is Brahman: To him what is seen as oblations is nothing but Brahman In the same way brahmaagnau (this is a compound word) in the fire of Brahman: The fire into which oblation is hutam poured; brahmana by Brahman by the agent is Brahman Itself The meaning is that Brahman Itself is the agent (of the offering) That he makes the offeringthe act of offering that is also Brahman And the result that is gantavyam to be reached by him; that also is brahma eva surely Brahman Brahmakarmasamadhina by him who has concentration on Brahman as the objective: Brahman Itself is the objective (karma); he who has concentration (samadhi) on That is brahmakarmasamdhih The goal to be reached by him is Brahman alone Thus even the action undertaken by one who desires to prevent mankind from going astray is in reality inaction for it has been sublated by the realization of Brahman This being so in the case of the monk from whom aciton has dropped off who has renounced all activity viewing his Knowledge as a (kind of) sacrifice too becomes all the more justifiable from the point of view of praising full realization That is whatever is well known as ladle etc in the context of a sacrifice all that in the context of the Self is Brahman Itself to one who has realized the supreme Truth If not so then since all in Brahman it would have been uselesss to specifically mention ladle etc as Brahman Therefore all actions cease to exist for the man of realization who knows that Brahman Itself is all this And this follows also from the absence (in him) of the idea of accessories [See note on pTr] For the act called 'sacarifice' is not seen to exist without being in association with the idea of accessories All such acts as Agnihotra etc are associated with the ideas of such accessories as making an offering etc to the particular gods who are revealed in the scriptures and with the idea of agentship as also desire for results But they are not found bereft of the ideas of such distinctions as exist among action accessories and results or unassociated with the ideas of agentship hankering for results This (apparent) (activity of the man of Knowledge) however stands dissociated from the ideas of differences among the accessories like ladle etc actions and results which get destroyed by the Knowledge of Brahman Hence it is inaction to be sure And thus has it been shown in 'He who finds inaction in action' () 'he really does not do anything even though engaged in action' () 'the organs act on the objects of the organs' () 'Remaining absorbed in the Self the knower of Reality should think ""I certainly do not do anything""' () etc While pointing out thus the Lord demolishes in various places the ideas of differences among actions accessories and results And it is also seen in the case of rites such as Agnihotra undertaken for results (kamya) that the Agnihotra etc cease to be (kamya) rites undertaken for selfish motives when the desire for their results is destroyed Similarly it is seen that actions done intentionally and unintentionally yeild different results So here as well in the case of one who has his ideas of distinctions among accessories like ladle etc actions and results eliminated by the knowledge of Brahman even activites which are merely external movements amount to inaction Hence it was said 'gets totally destroyed' Here some say: That which is Brahman is the ladle etc It is surely Brahman Itself which exists in the five forms [Asscessories that can be indicated by the five grammatical caseending viz Nominative Objective Instrumental Dative and Locative (As for instance the sacrificer oblation ladle sacrificial fire and BrahmanTr) of accessories such as the ladle etc and it is Itself which undertakes actions There the ideas of ladle etc are not eradicated but the idea of Brahman is attributed to the ladle etc as one does the ideas of Visnu etc to images etc or as one does the idea of Brahman ot name etc Reply: True this could have been so as well if the context were not meant for the praise of jnanayajna (Knowledge considered as a sacrifice) Here however after presenting full realization as expressed by the word jnanayajna and the varieties of rites as referred to by the word yajna (sacrifice) Knowledge has been praised by the Lord in 'Jnanayajna (Knowledge considered as a sacrifice) is greater than sacrifices reiring materials' () And in the present context this statement 'the ladle is Brahman' etc is capable of presenting Knowledge as a sacrifice; otherwise since Brahman is everything it will be purposeless to speak specially only of ladle etc as Brahman But those who maintain that one has to superimpose the idea of Brahman on the ladle etc like superimposing the idea of Visnu and others on images etc and of Brahman on name etc for them the knowledge of Brahma stated (in the verse) cannot be the intended subjectmatter dealt with here because according to them ladle etc are the (primary) objects of knowledge (in the context of the present verse) Besides knowledge in the form of superimposition of an idea cannot lead to Liberation as its result; and what is said here is 'Brahman alone in to be realized by him' Also it is inconsistent to maintain that the result of Liberation can be achieved without full realization And it goes against the contextthe context being of full realization This is supported by the fact that (the subject of ) full realization is introduced in the verse 'He who finds inaction in action' and at the end (of this chapter) the conclusion pertains to that very subjectmatter The chapter comes to a close by eulozing full realization itself in 'Jnanayajna (Knowledge considered as a sacrifice) is greater than sacrifices reiring materials' 'Achieving Knowledge one৷৷attains supreme Peace' () etc That being so it is unjustifiable to suddenly say out of context that one has to superimpose the idea of Brahman on the ladle etc like the superimposition of the idea of Visnu on images Therefore this verse bears the meaing just as it has been already explained As to that after having presented Knowledge as a sacrifice other sacrifices also are being mentioned now in the verses beginning with '(Other yogis undertake) sacrifice to gods alone' etc for eulogizing that Knowledge:",,,The expression 'Brahman is the instrument to offer with' (It is to be remembered that in Ramanuja's system 'Brahman' in the primary sense is the 'Whole' with the Supreme Being as the Soul and Atmans and Matter (Prakrti) as His body in inseparable union with the Whole So the word 'Brahman' can according to the needs of each context be used to indicate the Supreme Being the Atman or Prakrti; In verse it has been used in all these senses We have therefore put it in italics See Introduction) is adjectival to 'the oblation' That by which an offering is given such as a ladle is an Arpana It is called Brahman because it is an effect of Brahman Brahman being the material cause of the universe 'Brahmaarpanam' is the oblation of which the instrument is Brahman The oblation just like the instrument with which it is offered is also Brahman It is offered by the agent Brahman into the fire of Brahman He is the Brahmakarmasamadhi who contemplates thus on all acts as filled with the Supreme Brahman or as having the Supreme Brahman as the Self He who contemplates on Brahman as the Soul of all actions reaches Brahman alone as his own self has the Supreme Brahman as Its Self The meaning is that the individual self which is Brahman because of Its having Brahman as Its Self has to realise Its own real nature All actions performed by an aspirant for release have the form of knowledge because of their association with the contemplation of the Supreme Brahman as their self They are a direct means for the vision of the self without the meditation of Jnana Yoga Thus Sri Krsna after explaining how Karma takes the form of knowledge now speaks of the various kinds of Karma Yoga

Reply: This defect does not arise Although the estion was put by Arjuna merely with regard to renunciation and Karmayoga yet the Lord without actually avoiding them and by adding something special which was intended by Him gave the answer by expressing them through other words 'Sankhya' and '(Karma) yoga' Those very 'renunciation and 'Karmayoga' when they are (respectively) associated with Knowledge and such of Its means as eanimity etc are meant by the words 'Sankhya' and 'yoga' This is the Lord's veiw Therefore there is no discussion out of the context How can the result of both be attained by the proper performance of only one? The answer is:,,,Those who say that Karma Yoga and Jnana Yoga are distinct because of the difference in results are children ie are persons with incomplete knowledge; they do not know the entire truth The meaning is that they do not possess true knowledge who say that Karma Yoga results in Jnana Yoga only and that Jnana Yoga alone results in the vision of the self and that the two are thus distinct because of the difference in their fruits But on the contrary as both have only the vision of the self as the fruit a person who is firmly set in one of them wins that one fruit common to both Sri Krsna further expounds the same:

Why then is it said 'Among the two Karmayoga however excels renunciation of actions'? Reply: Hear the reason for this: Having is veiw the mere giving up of actions and Karmayoga your estion was as to which one was better of the two My answer was accordingly given that Karmayoga excels renunciation of actions (resorted to) without Knowledge is Sankhya This is what was meant by me And that is indeed yoga in the highest sense However that which is the Vedic Karmayoga is figuratively spoken of as yoga and renunciation since it leads to it (supreme Knowledge) How does it lead to that? The answer is:,,,The fruit in the form of the vision of the self which is attained by the Sankhyans (ie) Jnana Yogins the same is attained alone by those who are Karma Yogins He alone is wise who sees that Sankhya and the Yoga are one and the same because of their having the same result Sri Krsna points out if the aforesaid is the case wherein the difference between them lies

Indeed one is not stained by what another does' This act is nothing but dedicating one's actions to the Brahman In this regard the characteristic mark is his detachment Due to that he is not stained Because they do not have attachment the men of Yoga perform actions only with their body etc that are freed from attachment and do not depend on each other,,,,,,Since tyaktva by giving up sangam attachment with regard to results; yoginah the yogis men of action; kurvanti undertake; karma work; kevalaih merely this word is to be construed with each of the words body etc so as to deny the idea of ownership with regard to all actions; kayena through the body; manasa through the mind; buddhya through the intellect; and api even; indriyaih through the organs which are devoid of the idea of ownership which are unassociated with ownership thus: 'I act only for God and not for my gain'; atmasudhaye for the purification of themselves ie for the purification of the heart therefore you have competence only for that So you undertake action alone And also since,,,Renouncing attachment to heaven etc the Yogins perform actions accomplishable by the body the mind and the intellect for the purification of themselves ie for annulling the bonds of his previous Karma which have afected the self and which involve the self in Samsara

This is being answered: Navadvare pure in the town with nine gates of which seven [Two ears two eyes nostrils and mouth] are in the head for one's own experiences and two are below for urination and defecation As possessed of those gates it is called the 'town with nine gates' Being like a town the body is called a town with the Self as its only master And it is inhabited by the organs mind intellect and objects like citizens as it were which serve its needs and which are productive of many results and experience Renouncing all actions the dehi embodied one resides in that town with nine gates Objection: What is the need of this specification? For all embodied beings be they monks or not reside in bodies to be sure! That being so the specification is needless The answer is: The embodied one however who is unenlightened who perceives merely the aggregate of the body and organs as the Self he in his totality thinks 'I am in a house on the ground or on the seat' For one who experiences the body alone as the Self there can certainly be no such conviction as 'I am in the body like one's being in a house' But for one who realizes the Self as distinct from the aggregate of body etc it becomes reasonable to have the conviction 'I am in the bdoy It is reasonable that as a result of knowledge in the form of discriminating wisdom there can be a mental renunciation of the actions of others which have been ignorantly superimposed on the supreme Self Even in the case of one in whom has arisen discriminating wisdom and who has renounced all actions there can be like staying in a house the continuance in the body itselfthe town with nine gatesas a conseence of the persistence of the remnants of the results of past actions which have started bearing fruit because the awareness of being distinct (from the body) arises while one is in the body itself Form the point of veiw of the difference between the convictions of the enlightened and the unenlightened persons the alifying words 'He continues in the body itself' do have a purpose to serve Although it has been stated that one continues (in the body) by relinishing actions of the body and organs ignorantly superimposed on the Self still there may be the apprehesion that direct or indirect agentship inheres in the Self Anticipating this the Lord says: na eva kurvan without himself doing anything at all; and na karayan not causing (others) to do (not) inducing the body and organs to activity Objection: Is it that the direct or indirect agentship of the embodied one inheres in the Self and ceases to be after renunciation as the movement of a traveller ceases with the stoppage of his movement? Or is it that they do not exist owing to the very nature of the Self? As to this the answer is: The Self by Its nature has neither direct nor indirect agentship For it was stated 'It is said that৷৷This (Self) is unchangeable' () 'O son of Kunti although existing in the body It does not act nor is It affected' () And it is also stated in the Upanisad 'It seems to meditate as it were; It seems to move as it were' (Br ),,,The embodied self who is selfcontrolled renounces all actions to the city of nine gates ie the body with its sensory and motor functions which are nine in number He discriminates that all actions are due to conjunction of the self with the body which is rooted in previous Karmas and is not by Its own nature [It means that the self merely rests in the body without any identification with bodily activities] Sri Krsna now teaches the natural condition of the self as It is:

na karmaphalasaṃyogaṃ svabhāvastu pravartate ||5-14||",,Neither agency nor actions does the Lord create for the world nor union with the fruits of actions But it is Nature that acts,The Lord of this universe has not ordained activity or any incentive thereto or any relation between an act and its consequences All this is the work of Nature,,The Lord (Self) acires neither the state of being a creator of the world nor the actions nor the connecting with the fruits of their actions But it is the inherent nature [in It] that exerts,The lord of the body (the self ie the Jiva) does not create agency nor actions nor union with the fruits of actions in relation to the world of selves It is only the inherent tendencies that function,The Self does not create agentship or any objects (of desire) for anyone; nor association with the results of actions But it is Nature that acts,,Na kartrtvam etc This Soul does not do anything for anything But Its exertion is only Its inherent nature and it is not due to any desire for results For the Bhagavat the Conscious Energy Itself Whose ultimately true inherent nature is the IlluminationBlissFreedomofWill and Which brings out merely by Its own nature the continuous series of creation manitenance and withdrawl of all (the Universe); hence in It there is never a departure even to a little extent from Its own inherent nature Hence there is no such thing as a particular stage of being a creator ie a creatorhood separate [from Itself] Because that does not exist what actions can be there ? If actions are not there the fruit is to be of what or for whom ? Then what connection could be three with the fruit of action ? [Further] 'action' in this context is [only] the kriya[sakti] or creative energy [which is nothing but His will] and 'result of action' too in only the fruit of this kriya For example the activity like rotating the [potter's] wheel by the stick is not [actually] different [from what is to be created ie the pot] Nor the creator of the pot is different from it For all exist within the Conscious Energy Therefore it is only the Animate Sovereign Supreme Lord that manifests in this and that form Therefore there exist no activity and its result etc apart from That This is demonstrated conclusion [of the scriptures] So if there is no activity or its result [as stated above] then even the result ordained in [the scriptural] injunctions cannot have a status of being produced by the unseen [cause] After saying this in the other first hemistich [of the following verse] the Lord justifies in the other hemistich the same statement with reference to the men of mundane life :,,,,,,Prabhuh the Self; na srjati does not create; lokasya for anyone; kartrtvam agentship by saying 'Do this'; or even karmani any objectssuch objects as chariot pot palace etc which are intensely longed for; nor even karmaphalasamyogam association with the results of actionsassociation of the creator of a chariot etc with the result of his work Objection: If the embodied one does not do anything himself and does not make others do then who is it that engages in work by doing and making others do? The answer is: Tu but; it is svabhavah Nature one's own (sva) nature (bhava)characterized as ignorance Maya which will be spoken of in 'Since this divine Maya' (); pravartate that acts But from the highest standpoint,,,When the world of embodied selves exists in conjunction with the Prakrti in the form of gods animals men immobile things etc the master (Prabhu ie the Jiva who is the master of the body) who is not subject to Karma and is established in Its own essential nature does not bring about: (i) the agency of gods men etc (ii) their manifold and particular actions and (iii) their connection with the fruits in the form of embodiment as gods etc resulting from their actions Who then brings about agency etc? It is only the tendencies that act A tendency (Svabhava) is subtle impressions (Vasanas) originating from Prakrti The meaning is that agency etc do not originate from the natural or pristine condition of the self but are generated by the subtle impressions created by misconceiving those forms of Prakrti etc as of the self This is the result of the conjunction of the self with Prakrti in the form of gods etc which has been generated by the flow of previous Karmas brought about in beginningless time

In answer it is said that knowledge is enveloped by the darkness of ignorance The Atman's knowledge is enveloped ie contracted by preceding Karmas which are opposed to knowledge so that a person may be alified to experience the fruits of his own Karma It is by this Karma which contracts knowledge and can join the Jiva with the bodies of gods etc that the misconception that the bodies are the selves is produced Conseently there will originate the Vasanas or the unconscious subtle impressions born of such misapprehension of the self and the inclination to undertake actions corresponding to them Sri Krsna now brings into proper seence what has been taught before in the following verses: 'You will completely cross over the sea of all your sins with the boat of knowledge' () and 'The fire of knowledge reduces all Karmas to ashes in the same way' () and 'For there is no purifier here eal to knowledge' ()

Why are monasticism and meditativeness spoken of here with regard to one who keeps a fire and is a man of actionwhich is not accepted as a fact? Reply: This defect does not arise because both are sought to be asserted in some secondary sense Objection: How is that? Reply: His being monk is by virtue of his having given up hankering for the results of actions; and his being a man of meditation is from the fact of his doing actions as accesories to meditation or from his rejection of thoughts for the results of actions which cause disturbances in the mind Thus both are used in a figurative sense On the contrary it is not that monasticism and meditativeness are meant in the primary sense With a veiw to pointing out this idea the Lord says:,,,The Lord said He who without depending on such fruits of works as heaven etc performs them reflecting 'The performance of works alone is my duty (Karya) Works themselves are my sole aim because they are a form of worship of the Supreme Person who is our Friend in every way There is nothing other than Him to be gained by them' such a person is a Sannyasin ie one devoted to Jnana Yoga and also a Karma Yogin ie one devoted to Karma Yoga He is intent on both these which is the means for attaining Yoga which is of the nature of the vision of the self 'And not he who maintains no sacred fires and performs no works' ie not he who is disinclined to perform the enjoined works such as sacrifices etc nor he who is devoted to mere knowledge The meaning is that such a person is devoted only to knowledge whereas a person who is devoted to Karma Yoga has both knowledge and works Now Sri Krsna teaches that there is an element of knowledge in the Karma Yoga as defined above

Renunciation is in fact what is called Right Action No one can become spiritual who has not renounced all desire,,What [the learned] call renunciation O son of Pandu know that to be [the same as] the Yoga For without renouncing intention [for fruit] one does not become a man of Yoga,That which is called Sannyasa (Jnana Yoga) know that to be Yoga (Karma Yoga) O Arjuna For (among Karma Yogins) no one whose delusive identification of the body with the self is not abandoned becomes a true Karma Yogin,That which they call monasticism know that to be Yoa O Pandava For nobody who has not given up expectations can be a yogi,,The subject matter that has been thus established in the series of the preceding chapters is summarised by a couple of verses Anasritah etc Yam etc Bounden : Ordained [in the law books] according to one's caste etc [Thus] manlfrenunciation and manofYoga are synonyms That is why [the Lord] says 'what [the learned] call renunciation' etc Therefore without Yoga no renunciation is possible Similarly Yoga is not possible without renouncing the intention [for fruit] Conseently the Yoga and renunciation are ever interlinked The idea suggested by 'not he who remains [simply] without his fires etc' is this : He remains neither without fires nor without actions and yet he is man of renunciation Hence this is strange Of course following the principle [involved in the statement] 'Playing dice is the kingship without throne' and following logic it has been asserted already that renunciation is not possible for a person who remains simply without actions Yet,,,,,,Yam that which is characterized by the giving up of all actions and their results; which prahuh they the knowers of the Vedas and the Smrtis call; sannyasam iti monasticism in the real sense; viddhi known; tam that monasticism in the real sense; to be yogam Yoga consisting in the performance of actions O Pandava Accepting what kind of similarity between Karmayoga which is characterized by engagement (in actions) and its opposite renunciation in the real sense which is characterized by cessation from work has their eation been stated? When such an apprehension arises the answer is this; From the point of view of the agent there does exist a simialrity of Karmayoga with real renunciation For he who is a monk in the real sense from the very fact of his having given up all the means needed for accomplishing actions gives up the thought of all actions and their resultsthe source of desire that leads to engagement in work [Thoughts about an object lead to the desire for it which in turn leads to actions for getting it (Also see note under )] also even while performing actions gives up the thought for results Pointing out this idea the Lord says: Hi for; kascit nobody no man of action whosoever; asannyastasankalpah who has not given up expactaionsone by whom has not been renounced expectation anticipation of results;bhavati becomes ie can become; yogi a yogi a man of concentration because thought of results is the cause of the disturbance of mind Therefore any man of action who gives up the thought of results would become a yogi a man of concentration with an unperturbed mind because of his having given up thought of results which is the cause of mental distractions This is the purport Thus because of the similarity of real monasticism with Karmayoga from the point of veiw of giving up by the agent Karmayoga is extolled as monasticism in 'That which they call monasticism know that to be Yoga O Pandava' Since Karmayoga which is independent of results is the remote help to Dhyanayoga therefore it has been praised as monasticism Thereafter now the Lord shows how Karmayoga is helpful to Dhyanayoga:,,,Know Karma Yoga only to be that which they call as Sannyasa ie as Jnana Yoga or knowledge of the real nature of the self Sri Krsna substantiates this by the words 'For no one whose delusive identification of the body with the self is not abandoned becomes a true Karma Yogin' 'One whose delusion is abandoned is one by whom the delusion of identifying the self with Prakrti (body) which is in reality distinct from the self is not rejected by the contemplation of the real nature of the self One who is not of this kind is one whose delusion is not abandoned One who is not of this kind cannot become a Karma Yogin of the type described here It has already been said: 'He whose every undertaking is free from desire for fruits and delusive identification of the body with the self ৷৷' () Sri Krsna now teaches that by Karma Yoga alone one succeeds in Yoga without the risk of fall

He has no support and is confused on the path leading to the Brahman He is without any support in the sense that Karma or rituals which constitutes the means of heaven etc does not give support for a person who is devoid of attachment to fruits; for Karma is the means for generating its own fruits He is also confused in the path leading to the Brahman on which he has just begun to traverse; He has lost his way Does he then get lost by falling down from both sides these being attainment of heaven on the one hand and liberation on the other Does he not thus perish? You should remove this doubt altogether from my mind; for there is no other remover of this doubt than You who always perceive directly all matters simultaneously

who is totally addicted to devotion and faith and who serves ie internally experiences Me alone and not anything else following the method of tradition learnt by rendering service to the revered teachershe alone among all the Yogins is the best master of the Yoga ie one who is fully absorbed in the Supreme Lord Thus the superiority of the Yoga with Godly knowledge over all [other means] has been explained,,,,,,Api even;

who has 'faith' ie who strives rapidly to attain Me because of his being unable to bear a moment's separation from Me on account of My being very dear to him; and who 'worships Me' ie serves Me with devotion and meditates on Me Me whose sportive delight brings about the origination sustentation and dissolution of the entire cosmos filled with multifarious and innumerable objects of enjoyment enjoyers means and places of enjoyment; who is untouched by any evil without exception; whose divine figure is the treasuehouse of innumerable multitudes of auspicious unlimited and unsurpassed attributes such as knowledge power lordship energy potency and splendour; whose divine figure is the treasurehouse of infinite unsurpassed attributes agreeable and highly worthy such as radiance beauty fragrance tenderness pervading sweetness and youthfulness which are uniform inconceivable and divine wondrous eternal and flawless; whose essential nature and alities transcend all thought and words; who is the great ocean of compassion condescension paternal love and beauty; who is the impartial refuge of all beings without exception and without considerations of any difference; who is the reliever of the distress of supplicants; who is the great unfathomable ocean of affection for supplicants; who has become visible to the eyes of all men without abandoning His essential nature; who has incarnated in the house of Vasudeva; who has made the entire would illumined with His limitless and excellent glory; and who has satisfied the entire universe with the impeccable glory of beauty The idea is that I who by Myself alone see all things directly as they are look upon him the last mentioned type of Yogi here as superior to all other types mentioned earlier

This is being answered:,,,(a) This Maya of Mine consists of the three Gunas Sattva Rajas and Tamas Because it is created by Me the Divine for purpose of sport it is divine in its power and therefore difficult to overcome The word Maya is used for the effects of the three Gunas because it has got the power of generating wonderful effects as in the case of the magic of Asuras and Raksasas See the passages: 'Then the excellent discus the flaming Sudarsana was despatched by the Lord to defend the boy The thousand Mayas or wonderfully created weapons of the evildesigned Sambara were foiled one after another by that ickly moving discus for protecting the body of the boy' (V P ) Here the term Maya does not signify the sense of 'false' Even with regard to magicians when the term Mayavin (one who possesses Maya) is used there is origination of real impressions with the aid of certain incantations herbs etc though the objects created are illusory things Accordingly the term Maya denotes the incantations herbs etc which have got the power of creating real impressions Inasmuch as the sense of the term should be invariable following the usage in all cases the term Maya can be applied to the illusory objects only in a secondary sense while its primary sense in regard to the real impressions generated in the mind It is just like in the statement 'The cots cry' The Maya of the Lord which is absolutely real and which consists of the Gunas is alone taught in the texts like 'Know then Maya to be the Prakrti and the possessor of the Maya to be the great Lord' (Sve U ) It not only obscures the essential nature of the Lord but also creates the condition of the mind that sees its objects as enjoyable Therefore the entire universe deluded by the Lord's Maya does not know the Lord who is of the nature of boundless beatitude (On the other hand they feel objects set forth by Maya as enjoyable) Sri Krsna teaches the way of deliverance from Maya: (b) But those who take refuge in Me alone Me whose resolves are always true who has supreme compassion and who is the refuge of all beings without exception and without consideration of their particular status such persons shall pass beyond this Maya of Mine consisting of the three Gunas The meaning is that they worship Me alone renouncing the Maya Why then do all not take recourse to refuge in the Lord which is conducive to the worship of the Lord?

The answer is:,,,The men of 'small understanding' means those whose understanding is poor who worship only Indra and other divinities The fruit of their worship is small and finite Why? The worshippers of divinities like Indra go to the divinities And Indra and other divinities possess limited joy and live only for a limited time So if they attain eality of enjoyment with them they also fall down along with them in due course; but My devotees knowing that their acts are of the nature of My worship renouncing attachment for finite fruits reach Me having for their purpose the pleasing of Me alone That is they never more return to Samsara For Sri Krsna teaches later on: 'But on reaching Me there is no rirth O Arjuna' () Now Sri Krsna declares: 'But these others (ie who worship Indra etc) regard as insignificant even My incarnations among men and other beings in order to make Myself easy for all to resort to'

In anticipation of such a estion the Lord says this:,,,I know all being that have passed away those that live now and those that will hereafter But no one knows Me Among the beings existing in the threefold divisions of time whom I look after no one understands Me as of the nature described and as Vasudeva incarnated to be a refuge for all So no one resorts to Me Therefore the one who knows Me really (Jnanin) is extremely difficult to be found Such is the meaning So also:

Man lives in a fairy world deceived by the glamour of opposite sensations infatuated by desire and aversion,,O descendant of Bharata O scorcher of foes ! At the time of creation all beings get delusion because of the illusion of pairs [of opposites] arising from desire and hatred,By the delusion of the pairs of opposites springing from desire and hate O Arjuna all beings are deluded as soon as they are born,O scion of the Bharata dynasty O destroyer of foes due to the delusion of duality arising from likes and dislikes all creatures become bewildered at the time of their birth,,Icchaetc [At the time of destruction] he (the personal Soul) is led to expand exceedingly while he still remains unconcious on account of his desire aversion agner dellusion etc On account of this the entire world takes recourse to the sleeping stage while it continues to exist in its entirity within the stomach of the Prakrti (the Prime Casue); and to exist just being (temporarily) not capable of performing its activities For as long as there is delusion the mental impressions are to be experienced as in the case of the sleeping stage in the night time every day But on that account no emancipation is gained For when the experience of loss of unconsciousness is over (ie when consciousness is regained) again the mundane life with its varieties of activites is found,,,,,,Icchadvesasamutthena by what arises from likes and dislikes: iccha likes and dvesa dislikes are icchadvesau; anything arising from them is icchadvesasamutthah (Creatures are duluded) by that By what? When that is thus sought to be known in particular the Lord answers: dvandvamohena by the delusion of duality Delusion (moha) that originates from duality (advandva) is dvandvamoha Those very likes and dislikes which are mutually opposed like heat and cold which relate to happiness and sorrow and their causes and which come into association with all beings in due course are termed as duality (and this deludes all creatures) As regards them when likes and dislikes arise from the experience of happiness sorrow and their causes then by bringing the wisdom of all beings under their control they create bewilderment which is the cause of the impediment to the rise of knowledg about the reality of Self the suprem Truth Indeed exact knowledg about objects even in the external world does not arise in one whose mind is overpowered by the defects viz likes and dislikes It goes without saying that knowledge of the indwelling Self beset with many obstacles as it is does not arise in a completely bewildered person whose intelligence has been overcome by them Therefore bharata O scion of the Bharata dynasty; owing to that delusion of duality arising from likes and dislikes sarvabhutani all creatures become deluded Parantapa O destroyer of foes; they yanti sammoham become bewildered come under delusion; sarge at the time of their birth ie at the time of their origination The idea is that all creatures that come into being do so prepossessed by delusion 'Since this is so therefore all creatures being deluded and having their wisdom obstructed by that delusion of duality do not know Me who am their Self Hence they do not adore Me as their Self' 'Who again are those that becoming free from the delusion of duality come to know You and adore You as the Self in accordance with the scriptures?' In order to elaborate the subject enired about it is being said:,,,As soon as beings are born they are deluded This delusion springs from sense experiences described as pairs of opposites like heat and cold Such reactions spring from desire and hate The purport is this: Desire and hatred for the pairs of opposites like pleasure and pain which are constituted of Gunas have their origin in the Jivas from the past experiences they had in their previous births The subtle impressions or Vasanas of these previous experiences manifest again as instinctive desire and hatred towards similar objects in every succeeding birth of the Jivas The delusive force of these impressions make them deluded from the very beginning It becomes their nature to have love or hatred for such objects in place of having happiness and misery at union with or separation from Me The Jnanin however feels happiness when he is in union with Me and misery when separated from Me No other being is born with such a nature as found in the Jnanin

This is being answered:,,,However there are some whose sins accruing from beginningless time which cause desire or hatred to the pairs of opposites and annual the tendency towards Me have come to an end ie have become weakened through the accumulation of good actions in numerous births They resort to Me devoid of delusion produced by the Gunas and worship Me alone in proportion to the excellence of their Karmas previously described In order to attain deliverance form old age and death and for aciring the supreme consummation of reaching Me they remain steadfast in their vows Sri Krsna enumerates what special things are to be known and what ought to be attained by these three classes of votaries of God:

Hence [to achieve this result the Lord] teaches also the means or device by 'Therefore' etc: The Bhagavat surely on His own accord becomes [even at the time of death] the object of memory of that person from whose heart (mind) the Bhagavat has never gone away in any cirucumstance connected with the mundane life also; who has [thus] renounced all his actions to the Bhagavat alone; and who is full of (fully absorbed in) the Bhagavat For this end the means is to remain constantly absorbed in the thought of the Bhagavat That is why He Says : 'With whatever object the internal organ of a person is filled up always that object alone is remembered by him at the time of death and the state of that being alone is attained [by him] Hence let a person by all means have Me alone as his goal and be desirous of attaining Me' This is the idea here The idea [intended here] is certainly not 'What is remembered without fail at the last moment that being alone is attained by him' Because in that case the attainment of the man of wisdom would also be just like that of an ignorant man For the former too [at the time of death] gets [complete] dulness of mind that is benumbed by the disorder (or defect) of he elements existing in his entire body Certainly it is not proper to accept this here For it would go agains the authority of the scriptures For the fact is 'He who has attained liberation simultaneously with realisation [of the Self] and whose sorrows [therefore] have been destroyed he attains completely unity [with the Absolute] even though [at the time of death] he has lost his memory and abandons his body in a sacred place or in the house of a dogcooker (ie man of a low tribe)' (PS ) Therefore the matteroffact statement (or explanation) and injunction [that are meant here] are the following : If a person's internal organ is absorbed incessantly in the thought of a particular being the same being is attained by him at end after departure It is immaterial whether [at the time of departure] that being is remembered or not This secondary importance [of the remembrance] is indicated by the word api 'also' The word va 'or' makes it clear that the rememberance does not exist in each and every case The Sage (Vyasa) himself clarifies his idea 'Let a man always remain by all means keeping Me (the Absolute Lord) as his supreme goal' Since the Sage says : 'Therefore at all times keep Me (the Absolute) in your mind' Therefore the following is the combination of words [of the verse intended here] : If a person remembering always or at the last moment the use of or denotes 'or not remembering [at the last moment]' a particular being leaves his body he attains that particular being alone For he is always absorbed in the thought of that being But others [interpret the verses as follows] : When one leaves his body as the end just at the moment of leaving the body ie at that moment which is not cognizable to the perceivers like relatives sons etc [standing nearby]; at that moment that comes last after the limbmovements like [heavy] breathing exertion hiccup convulsive utterance etc [have endred]; at that fraction of time when the bondage of pleasure pain and bewilderment is weakened as a result of the weakening of the control of the bodily strength; at that time that goes by the term dehatyajana 'the moment of casting the body off'; at that moment whatsoever being a person remembers his nature becomes entriely identical with that being favoured (taken as an object) by the First Consiousness the cause for remembering [the Lord] at that moment is to remanin ever absorbed in the thought of Him The word tyajati [of verse ] is to be construed as the seventh case [meaning 'at the time of abandoning'] Hence the purport [of the passage] is only what has been said above What is the use of such a remembrance of Him at the last moment ? But who told that [there] is a use [for it] ? But the remembrance is certainly brought about as a natural course at the last moment But this [proposition] would lead to an undersirable conseence For it has been observed that a person [usually] remberances at the last moment either the maintenance of his children wife and relatives or drinking of cold water and so on So he would become identical with those things It is not so The moment you speak of is not the last moment For at that moment the existence of body is being clearly felt Really that last moment which we would like to speak of can't be perceived by persons like you In what form alone the remembrance should be there at the last moment is decided by [its cause] a potential mental impression certainly arising at that time even though it is far off according to the general principle : 'The remembrance and the potential mental impression [that causes it] being identical in form there should be a seential immediacy [between them] even though they are removed [from one another] by many births by long distance and by long passage of time' (YS IV ) Thus depending on the potential mental impression there arises remembrance of a particular being and becuase of its remembrance one attains the identity of that being However in the case of certain body the same [process] is accidentally indicated even at the stage of healthy bodycondition See for example the remembrance of a deer etc [both in the healthy conditions and in the dying moment] and the conseential attainment of the deerhood as described in the Puranic literature That is why api ca 'and also' is employed in [the statement] like 'and also at the time of journey' Therefore those who constantly think of the Bhagavat with intention 'Let us become this Being'; they attain [in the following order] the identity with Absolute Lord of the exclusive nature of Consciousness : [First] there arises the thought (smarana) of the Lord at the moment when the bodily existence is felt; then at that unperceivable last moment the potential mental impression born of the said thought gives rise to the remembrance of the Lord by striking down all the other potential mental impressions according to the principle : 'The potential mental impression born therefrom make all other potential mental impressions powerless (YS I ) Then only at the moment of the fall of the body because at that time the mental impression created by [the sense of] time has come to an end and because the differences of the objects like 'this' 'that' etc are not feltat that moment he attains identity with the Lord This much of discussion is enough Without doubt (verse ) : one should not entertain any doubt in this regard,,,,,,Tasmat therefore; anusmara think of; mam Me in the way prescribed by the scriptures; sarvesu kalesu at all times; and yudhya fight engage yourself in war which is your own (caste) duty Asamsayah there is no doubt in this matter; that arpitamanobuddhih by dedicating your mind and intellect; mayi; to Me; esyasi youyou who have thus dedicated our mind and intellect to Me Vasudevawill attain; mam eva Me alone as I shall be remembered [When the Lord instructs Arjuna to think of Him and at the same time engage in war it may seem that He envisages a combination of Knowledge and action But this is not so because when one thinks of all actions accessories and results that come within the purview of the mind and the intellect as Brahman it is denied that actions etc have any separate reality apart from Brahman Therefore no combination is involved here] Besides,,,Therefore at all times until your departure remember Me day after day Engage yourself in actions appropriate to your station and stage in life which would make you remember Me These actions are prescribed by the Srutis and Smrtis and comprise the periodical and occasional rites Thus by this means with your mind and intellect set on Me you will remember Me at the time of death and thus attain to Me in the manner desired by you There is no doubt about this Thus having laid down the common principle that the attainment of one's end is dependent on one's last thought Sri Krsna proceeds to describe different modes of contemplation (Upasana) to be practised by the three groups of devotees for aciring their objectives Of these he first speaks about the modes of contemplation to be adopted by the seekers of enjoyments and power and the type of the last thought consistent with their contemplation

The meaning is: He who remembers Me for his whole life continuously To that yogi aham I; am sulabhah easy of attainment Since this is so therefore one should remain ever absorbed in Me with mind given to nothing else 'What follows from Your being easy of attainment?'

If You could set Your foot atleast for the duration of a single winking of the eye in [my] blemishless mind what else would You not accomplish [for me]' That is why with a view to satisfy those who raise the estion 'But the breaking [of body of the wise] has been found without remembrance [of the Lord] at the time of departure' here it is said 'He who [remembers Me] constantly with the mind not attached to any other thing' The meaning of it is : 'He whose mind is not attached to any other result to be achieved' For him I am easy to attain : For him there is no need to undertake the trouble of searching for a suitable time for departure; making pilgrimage to sacred places; [waiting for] the time of the summer solastice; taking shelter in the temples; augmenting the [Strand] Sattva; remaining absorbed in the thought [of the Lord]; [expecting] the auspicious moment of einox and of the day [time]; selecting a locality that is naturally pure; having body free from dirt of attachment (or unguent); wearing clean cloth; and similar other ones Hence it has been stated earlier [under VIII above] 'Either in a sacred place or in the house of a dogcooker' etc But it has been declared that 'He attains My State' Will there he rirth for him even after attaining that State ? Considering this doubt [the Lord] says :,,,,,,Partha O son of Prtha tasya yoginah to that yogi; nityayuktasya of constant concentration who is ever absorbed (in God); and ananyacetah of singleminded attention a yogi whose mind is not drawn to any other object; yah who; smarati remembers; mam Me the supreme God; satatam uninteruptedly; and nityasah for long By satatam uninterrupteldy is meant 'without any break' By niryasah is meant along duration Not six months nor even a year!

For it is heard [in the Puranas] that [the personal gods like] Brahma etc themselves exist indeed for a very long period How is it that they too are subject to return again ? If they are subject to return will they not be of the nature of having birth and death ? Expecting this objection [the Lord] says :,,,,,,O Arjuna all the lokah worlds; abrahmabhuvanat together with the world of Brahmabhuvana is that (place) in which creatures are born and brahmabhuvana means the world of Brahma; punah avartinah are subject to return are by nature liable to come again; Tu but; kaunteya O son of Kunti na vidyate there is no; punarjanma rirth; upetya after reaching; mam Me alone Why are all the worlds together with the realm of Brahma subject to return? Becuase they are limited by time How?,,,All the worlds from the realm of Brahma included in the Brahmanda (cosmic sphere) are spheres in which experiences conferring Aisvarya (prosperity and power) can be obtained But they are destructible and those who attain them are subject to return Therefore destruction ie return is unavoidable for the aspirants for Aisvarya as the regions where it is attained perish On the contrary there is no rirth to those who attain Me the Omniscient who has true resolves whose sport is creation sustentation and dissolution of the entire universe who is supremely compassionate and who is always of the same form For these reasons there is no destruction in the case of those who attain Me He now elucidates the timeperiod settled by the Supreme Person's will in regard to the evolution and dissolution of the worlds upto the cosmic sphere of Brahma and of those who are within them

This meaning certainly presupposes a conditon of disruption of one's own nature for sometime in the intervening period The auspicious Supreme Lord's real nature is His Absolute Freedom viz the Supreme Consciousness that transcends the universe yet remains identical with the universe and serves as the basis of the universe; and It is perennial Hence it cannot be assumed that there was some disruption at any time for this real nature and that the Supreme Lord regained that nature Hence it is rightly said 'Having attained Me' etc So far the behaviour of those persons who attain the Bhagavat by constant practice without much labour has been described Now a difference that lies between those who by departing will (or attain) emancipation and those who will enjoyment [of mundane life] is described :,,,,,,O son of Prtha sah that; parah purusah supreme unsurpassable Person(the word purusa) derived in the sense of 'residing in the heart' or 'allpervasiveness'; that Person compared to whom there is nothing superior; yasya in whom in which Person; antahsthani are included; bhutani (all) the beings which are Its productsfor a product remains inherent in its cause; and yena by whom by which Person; tatam is pervaded; sarvam all; idam this the Universe as pot etc are by space; is tu indeed; labhyah reached; through ananyaya onepointed; bhaktya through devotion characterized as Knowledge; ananyaya which is one pointed which relates to the Self The Northern Path meant for the attainment of Braman by the yogis under discussion who have superimposed the idea of Brahman on the syllable Om and who are destined to get Liberation in due course has to be stated Hence in order to present the intended idea the verse '(O best of the Bharata dynasty) of that time৷৷at which' etc is being recited The description of the Path of Return (in verse ) is by way of praising the other Path (of Departure in verse ):,,,That Supreme Person has been declared in such texts as 'There is nothing higher than Myself O Arjuna All this is strung on Me as rows of gems are on a thread' () and 'Who am beyond them and immutable' () He is the Supreme Person in whom all beings abide and by whom all this is pervaded He is to be attained by undivided devotion as described in 'Whose mind is not in anything else' () Now Sri Krsna teaches the 'path of light' described in the Srutis which is common to the knowers of the true nature of the self and to the persons who are devoted to the Supreme Person The nature of this path is alified as one of 'nonreturn to Samsara' In the case of a person journeying through the 'path of light' as described in the text of the worship of Five Fires is as follows: 'So those who know It (ie the eternal nature of the individual self) thus as taught in the Vidya of the Five Fires and those too who worhip in the forest with faith and Tapas go to the deity ruling over the rays of light and from there to the deity of the day' (Cha U ) The attainment of the Supreme Brahman and the nonreturn to birth are declared with reference to those who go by the path of light etc by the teaching that 'He the Supreme Being leads them to Brahman ৷৷ Those who reach by this path do not return to the (wordly) life of man' (Cha U ) This declaration of the goal in the text 'Those who know it thus etc' is not with reference to the attainment of the Atman which constitutes ony the limb of the science of Brahman as taught in the beginning of Prajapati's teaching For there will then arise purposelessness for the separate teaching of the same in regard to the principal science of the Supreme in the text 'Those who are in the forest worship by means of faith and austerity etc' (Cha U ) It is taught in the Vidya (meditation) of Five Fires: 'Thus indeed in the fifth oblation the waters become Purusa' (Cha U ) and 'Those with a balance of good Karmas ৷৷ and those with a balance of bad Karmas' (Ibid ) What is to be understood here is that the state of existence as men and other beings which has its origin in good and evil Karmas refer to the 'waters' which alone are mixed with other elements (ie to the bodymind); as for the self there is only contact with them and not identification Thus is declared the difference between intelligent self and inanimate matter Then by the texts 'Those who know this' (Ibid ) 'Those who go to the rays of light' (Ibid) and 'They who proceed by it return not to the human condition here' it is instructed that those who know this concerning the sentient and inanimate entities the one to be attained and the other to be rejected they jourey along the path described by the terms 'beginning with light and do not return to Samsara' On account of the passage 'He leads them to the Brahman' (Ibid ) which holds that the Brahman is attained by both the knower of real nature of the self and the devotees of the Supreme Person and also because of the axiom of 'results according to efforts' (Tatkratunyaya) the entity self separated from the inanimate matter should be constantly meditated upon as having its sole joy in absolute subservience to the Supreme Brahman who is Its self The self's nature of finding only joy consists in absolute subservience to the Surpeme Person This is proved from the Srutis like 'He who dwells within the self ৷৷ whose body is the self' (Sa Bra )

This is true He does arrange for it But the difference lies in this: Others who are devotees make their own efforts as well for their own sake to arrange for securing what they lack and protecting what they have On the contrary those who have realized nonduality do not make any effrot to arrange for themselves the acisition of what they do not have and the preservation of what they have Indeed they desire nothing for themselves in life or in death They have taken refuge only in the Lord Therefore the Lord Himself arranges to procure what they do not have and protect what they have got 'If you Yourself are the other gods even then do not their devotees too worship You alone?' 'Quite so!',,,There are Mahatmas who excluding everything else and having no other purpose meditate on Me as their only purpose because without Me they are unable to sustain themselves They think of Me and worship Me with all my auspicious attributes and with all my glories In the case of such devotees aspiring after eternal union with Me I Myself undertake the responsibility of bringing them to Myself (Yoga translated as 'prosperity') and of preserving them in that state for ever (Ksema translated as 'welfare') The meaning is that they do not return to Samsara

[ie the worshippers of other deities worship them knowingly and hence how can the estion of their ignorance arise?] This is being answered: Because,,,Those however who are devoted to Indra and other divinities who rely on the three Vedas alone and who possessed of faith worship Indra and other divinities they too worship Me actually in the light of the truth that all existing things constitute My body and have Me for their selves In the light of this principle terms like Indra denote Me only The worshippers of Indra and other deities therefore worship Me only in ways not sanctioned by the Sastras They do not worship Indra and other divinities with a proper understanding of the place of these deities in the light of the Vedanta texts An example is 'Wherein (ie in the Supreme Self) the sacrifices known as the Caturhotri attain their fulfilment through the divinities' (Tai Ar ) etc These texts say in what way these forms of worship apply to these divinties For all Vedanta texts lay down that the Supreme Person alone is to be worshipped directly when they enjoin the worship of Indra and other divinities as they form the body of the Supreme Person The meaning is that in the Caturhotri sacrifice like Agnihotra the full moon and the new moon sacrifices etc it is the Supreme Self only that is worshipped as He abides as the self in Indra etc who are the ostensible objects worshipped in these sacrifices by which these worshippers obtain their fulfilment through them Therefore the votaries of the three Vedas do not understand that these rituals form the worship of the Supreme Person and that He alone is to be worshipped As they do not do so they become experiencers of limited results and they are again liable to fall into Samsara Sri Krsna gives expressions to this:

By being votaries of gods they attain the gods etc (verse ) It amounts to say that this [fact of attaining these gods] is itself nothing but moving away [from Me the Self] On the other hand those who realise My nature (ie Me) as being not different [from their Self] they offer sacrifices to Me alone even though those sacrifices etc are for the gods goblins and manes' [The Lord] is going to conclude [the present topic] as : '(Thus) offering sacrifice to Me they attain Me alone' (IX) But that alone is called a deity which is aimed at [according to injunction] for offering things (ie oblation) Hence how can a sacrifice be offered to one's own Self a category that cannot be aimed at ? For example there is the injunction: 'The oblation [of rice] of the rite prayana crooked in the milk is intended for the deity Aditi'; and hence this Aditi becomes the object intended [in the sacrifice] because that particular deity is an adjunct of an injunction and because it is included in the injunction as one to be aimed at But [in the present case] there is no injunction that concerns the Self Having [these objections] in mind [the Lord] says : [They offer sacrifice] to Me following noninjunction The idea is this : An injunction is reired only in the case of a deity that is different from one's own Self For the injunction is one of the nature of imparting the knowledge only of that particular thing which is not known [otherwise] But one's own Self the Absolute Lord is known not following any injunction For the knowledge of the Self is not brought by injunction Certainly no action is undertaken not aiming the Self Therefore in all cases [of offerings] intended for the deities like Indra etc this Self of one's own is certainly intended as the Self is by nature the illuminator of the entire Universe; as It is like a thread in a garland; and as It is illumining [on Its own accord] asserting Its superiority [over all others] and only serving as a background (bhittih 'a screen' or 'a wall') of the manifestations of the deity so intended by him [in the sacrifice] Thus it is established by logic that even the votaries of gods offer sacrifices to Me (the Absolute) alone becuase 'I' depends on no injunction As far as these sacrificers are concerned the principal effect of the sacrifice viz attaining 'Me' is not intended by them as their own On the other hand they are very much satisfied with attaining the status of Indra etc just as a priest is satisfied with limited fees To indicate this the parasmaipada form (yajanti) [is used] For it has been stated by myself (Ag) [elsewhere] as : 'One who knows the Vedas and does not know [to intend for] the status of (or the word) Sambhu (the Absolute) would feel afflicted in despair [For] aspiring for the heaven and [hence] rejecting the status of [the actual] performer of of sacrifice (yajamana) [but at the same time] performing sacrifice for others (yajan) he has become a [mere] priest in the sacrifice Indeed the divergently flowing floods of taste for action without exception even though they flow from the Absolute consciousness do not bestow [on the performer] the mighty ocean of Bliss of one's own Self if they do not gain a complete stability' Thus whosoever realises in the said manner his sacrifice though aimed at the deities like Indra is in fact a sacrifice offered to the Absolute Lord Whatever may be the other actions of his they too become acts of worshipping his own Self the Absolute Lord as It alone is intended in all his action This [the Lord] says :,,,,,,Yah whoever; prayaccati offers; me Me; bhaktya with devotion; patram a leaf; puspam a flower phalam a fruit; or toyam water; asnami I accept; tat that (gift)leaf etc; prayataatmanah of the purehearted man; which has been bhaktiupahrtam devotionally presented Since this is so therefore,,,"Whoever offers to Me with true devotion a leaf or a flower or a fruit or water which can be easily obtained I accept it That true devotion is love of such an exalted kind that the devotee cannot sustain himself without making such offering; the devotee has no extraneous purpose other than serving Me Such an offering coming from a heart rendered pure with that singleness of purpose of considering the offering as an end in itself I the Lord of the universe whose sport consists in the origin maintenance and dissolution of the entire world who has all desires fulfilled whose will is always accomplished whose auspicious attributes are unlimited and unsurpassed who is enjoying the infinite and unsurpassed bliss that is in Myself I accept and enjoy the aforesaid type of offering as if I was obtaining a desired object far beyond the range of My hopes Thus it is declared in the Moksadharma: ""Whatever acts are consecrated by those whose intellects are concentrated in singlepointed devotion all these the Lord Himself accepts on His head"" (Ma Bha Sa ) Sri Krsna proceeds to say: As there is this distinctive excellence incomprehensible by speech and mind in respect of these great men called the Jnanins you also following them become a Jnanin ie have your self and all your belongings 'bent down' ie dedicated under the weight of Bhakti as prescribed earlier Be always singing My praises doing My services worshipping Me and prostrating before Me; also perform your secular and Vedic duties periodical and occasional in this manner'"

upto Matparayanah Those who are of sinful birth : Ie the animals birds reptiles etc Women denotes the ignorant Men of working class denotes those who find pleasure in different vocations like agriculture etc Men of the fourth caste : those who do not have any claim whatsoever for [performing] the Vedic rituals and whose livelihood depend on others By taking refuge [solely] in Me even these all attain Me alone The deeds of the exceedingly compassionate Bhagavat like the one granting liberation to a chief of the elephants are heard in thousands [in the Puranas] Certainly it must be so for those whose behaviour is just the opposite to that of these persons Some (commentators] declare : The present sentence [of the Lord] intends to glorify the twiceborn and members of the ruling class and it is not uttered with the intention of speaking of the attainment of liberation in the case of the women etc Indeed these persons [aim to] break into pieces the Graceoustoall Power of the Bhagavat by foistering upon It a limited applicability; likwise they do not tolerate the profoundly compassionate nature of the Absolute Lord; they contradict the [Lord's own] statements 'To Me none is hateful and none is dear (IX )' 'Even a highly evildoer etc (IX )' and other similar statements very clearly of the same import; with all effort they [strive to] bring in something indicative of duality even in the Absolutebeing Whose nondual nature has been well established firmly by the diversity of the best reasonings; they are not mindful of other contradictions [that lurk in their theory] with the revealed literature; when simply estioned 'How is this ?' and 'How is that ?' these persons having their internal organ totally possessed by the mighty devil of the caste [considerations] concealed within and having their tongue face and eyes all twisted by their sense of jealously hypocrisy and shamethey prattle evil for the entire humanity;

fix your mind on Me uninterruptedly like a continous stream of oil on Me the Ruler of rulers antagonistic to all that is evil the sole abode of auspiciousness omniscient whose resolve is always true the sole cause of the entire universe the Supreme Brahman the Supreme Person; on Me of long large eyes like a lotus petal; who has the complexion of a clear blue cloud; whose shining lustre is like that of a thousand suns simultaneously risen; on Me the great ocean of the nectar of beauty;

on Me the refuge of all without exception and without regard to their differences; on Me the Lord of all Sri Krsna again makes the same clear Be My devotee Be one whose mind is focussed on Me by contemplating on Me as exceedingly dear Such is the meaning He makes thie yet clearer Be My worshipper namely become engaged in My worship which you have begun to practise by your experience of Me as supremely dear and unlimited and unsurpassed What is called worship is the conduct of one who realises that he is absolutely a subsidiary (Sesa) of God Worship consists also in offering all things of enjoyment such as waving of lights etc all those things which come into bodily contact like garlands sandal paste etc and those meant for offering like food preparations and other edibles The meaning is this: Let your mind be focussed on Me so as to be engaged in My worship resulting from love which is unlimited and unsurpassed and which is born from the experience of Myself Again Sri Krsna expounds the same: Bow down to Me Do not be satisfied only with services of one who is absolutely subsidiary to me Do services which are incomparably dear and animated by an experience of Myself who is dear and unlimited and unsurpassed Also bow down to Me in utter humility regarding Me as the supreme goal ie He who is the supreme abode and the supreme goal The meaning is that having resorted to Me it is impossible for you to live without Me Having disciplined the mind in this way and considering Me as the supreme goal you will thus through love which is unsurpassed and incomparable obtain a mind which is fit for experiencing Me You will then reach Me alone Here the term Atman stands for the mind The import is that holding Me as the sole support possesing a mind of this kind meditating on Me experiencing Me worshipping Me and bowing down to Me you will reach Me alone Thus with such a turn of mind you carry on for pleasing Me alone your secular works for bodily sustenance and Vedic activities like obligatory and occasional rites regarding them as actuated by Me and finding sole joy in absolute subservience to Me You shall ever engage yourself in praising My names with love and in endeavouring to serve Me and bowing down to Me etc You shall contemplate on the entire universe as being under My rule and being subsidiary (Sesa) to Me Contemplating on the multitudes of My attributes which are exceedingly dear to you and practising every day this worship as described you will reach Me alone

It is appropriate that the universe rejoices and feels exceedingly delighted by the high glory of yours; that in fear the demons fly on all directions; and that the hosts of the perfected ones bow down [to You],Arjuna said Rightly it is O Krsna that Your praise should move the world to joy and love The Raksasas flee in fear on all sides and all the hosts of Siddhas bow down to You,Arjuna said It is proper O Hrsikesa that the world becomes delighted and attracted by Your praise; that the Raksasas stricken with fear run in all directions; and that all the groups of the Siddhas bow down (toYou),,Sthane etc By high glory : by highly singing the glory,,,,,,Sthane it is proper; what is that?that the jagat world; prahrsyati becomes delighted; tava prakirtya by Your praise by reciting Your greatness and hearing it This is befitting This is the idea Or the word sthane may be taken as alifying the word 'subject' (understood) : It is proper that the Lord is the subject of joy etc since the Lord is the Self of all beings and the Friend of all So also it (the world) anurajyate becomes attracted becomes drawn (by that praise) That also is with regard to a proper subject This is how it is to be explained Further that the raksamsi Raksasas; bhitani stricken with fear; dravanti run; disah in all directionsthat also is with regard to a proper subject And that sarve all; the siddhasanghah groups of the SiddhasKapila and others; namasyanti bow downthat also is befitting He points out the reason for the Lord's being the object of delight etc:,,,Arjuna said: 'Sthane' means rightly or it is but proper It is but proper that the whole world of gods Gandharvas Siddhas Yaksas Kinnaras Kimpurusas etc who have foregathered with a desire to see the battle should be delighted with You and love You after beholding You by Your grace You are the Lord of all Rightly after beholding You the Raksasas flee in fear on all sides and rightly all the host of Siddhas namely the host of Siddhas who are favourable to You pay their homage to You The connection with what was said earlier is that all this is as it ought to be He further proceeds to explain how all this is right:

O Infinite O Lord of the gods O You who have the universe for Your abode! You are the 'Aksara' What does not perish is the Aksara here the 'principle of individual self'; for the individual self does not perish as established in Sruti passages: 'The intelligent self is not born nor dies' (Ka U ) You alone are the 'existent and the nonexistent' the principle of Prakrti in its condition as effect and in its condition as cause This is denoted by the terms 'Sat' (existent) and 'Asat' (nonexistent) You alone are the state of effect denoted by the term 'Sat' which is the state of diversification by names and forms and also the state of cause denoted by the tetm 'Asat' which is the state incapable of such divisions and diversities 'What is beyond both' what is beyond Prakrti and the individual self associated with the Prakrti as also from the principle of liberated selves who are different from those associated with Prakrti ie bound souls You alone are that also Therefore:

When renunciation of fruits of actions is achieved there arises an uninterrupted peace Therefore being the root of all [these] the knowledge a'one in the form of fixing the mind in the Lord is important,,,,,,"Jnanam knowledge; [Firm conviction about the Self arrived at through Vedic texts and reasoning] is hi surely; sreyah superior; to what?abhyasat to practice [Practicerepeated effort to ascertain the true meaning of Vedic texts in order to acire knowledge] which is not preceded by discrimination Dhyanam meditation undertaken along with knowledge; visisyate surpasses even jnanat that knowledge Karmaphalatyagah renunciation of the results of works; excels even dhyanat meditation associated with knowledge ('Excels' has to be supplied) Tyagat from this renunciation of the results of actions in the way described before; [By dedicating all actions to God with the idea 'May God be pleased'] santih Peace the cessation of transmigratory existence together with its cause; follows anantaram immediately; not that it awaits another accasion Should the unenlightened person engaged in works be unable to practise the disciplines enjoined earlier then for him has been enjoined renunciation of the results of all works as a means to Liberation But this has not been done at the very beginning And for this reason renunciation of the results of all works has been praised in 'Knowledge is surely superior to practice' etc by teaching about the successive excellence For it has been taught as being fit to be adopted by one in case he is unable to practise the disciplines already presented [Presented from verse onwards] Objection: From what similarly does the eulogy follow? Reply: In the verse 'When all desires clinging to one's heart fall off' (Ka ) it has been stated that Immortality results from the rejection of all desires That is well known And 'all desires' means the 'result of all rites and duties enjoined in the Vedas and Smrtis' From the renunciation of these Peace surely comes immediately to the enlightened man who is steadfast in Knowledge There is a similarity between renunciation of all desires and renunciation of the results of actions by an unenlightened person Hence on account of that similarity this eulogy of renunciation of the results of all actions is meant for rousing interest As for instance by saying that the sea was drunk up by the Brahmana Agastya the Brahmanas of the present day are also praised owing to the similarity of Brahminhood In this way it was been said that Karmayoga becomes a means for Liberationsince it involves renunciaton of the rewards of works Here again the Yoga consisting in the concentration of mind on God as the Cosmic Person as also the performance of actions etc for God have been spoken of by assuming a difference between God and Self In 'If you are unable to do even this' () since it has been hinted that it (Karmayoga) is an effect of ignorance therefore the Lord is pointing out that Karmayoga is not suitable for the meditator on the Immutable who is aware of idenity (of the Self with God) The Lord is similarly pointing out the impossibility of a karmayogin's meditation on the Immutable In (the verse) 'they৷৷attain Me alone' () having declared that those who meditate on the Immutable are independent so far as the attainment of Liberation is concerned the Lord has shown in '৷৷I become the Deliverer' () that others have no independence; they are dependent on God For if they (the former) be considered to have become identified with God they would be the same as the Immutable on account of (their) having realized nondifference Conseently speaking of them as objects of the act of deliverance will become inappropriate! And since the Lord in surely the greatest wellwisher of Arjuna He imparts instructions only about Karmayoga which involves perception of duality and is not associated with full Illumination Also no one who has realized his Self as God through valid means of knowledge would like subordination to another since it involves a contradiction Therefore with the idea 'I shall speak of the group of virtues (as stated in) ""He hwo is not hateful towards any creature"" etc which are the direct means to Immortality to those monks who meditate on the Immutablewho are steadfast in full enlightenment and have given up all desires' the Lord proceeds:",,,More than the practice of remembrance (of the Lord) which is difficult in the absence of love for the Lord the direct knowledge of the self arising from the contemplation of the imperishable self (Aksara) is conducive to the wellbeing of the self Better than the imperfect knowledge of the self is perfect meditation on the self as it is more conducive to the wellbeing of the self More conducive than imperfect meditation (ie meditation unaccompanied with renunciation) is the activity performed with renunciation of the fruits It is only after the annihilation of sins through the performance of works accompanied by renounciation of fruits that peace of mind is attained When the mind is at peace perfect meditation on the self is possible From meditation results the direct realisation of the self From the direct realisation of the self results supreme devotion It is in this way that Atmanistha or devotion to the individual self becomes useful for a person who is incapable of practising loving devotion to the Supreme Being And for one practising the discipline for attaining the self (Jnana Yoga) without acisition of perfect tranillity of mind disinterested activity (Karma Yoga) including in it meditation on the self is the better path for the knowledge of the self [Thus the steps are performance of works without desire for fruits eanimity of mind meditation on the self selfrealisation and devotion to the Lord] Now Sri Krsna enumerates the attributes reired of one intent on performance of disinterested activity:

The answer is no,,,The body which is cognised in identity with the experiencing self by coordinate predication (Samanadhikaranya) in the propositions 'I am a god 'I am a man' 'I am fat' 'I am slender' etc is described by those who know the real nature of the body as only the Field (Ksetra) of experience for the experiencing self who is distinct from the body Those who know this namely those who know the exact nature of the self call It the Fieldknower (Ksetrajna) That knower who knows the body as divided into its different members and as their collectivity can say 'I know it the body as an object' The person with this perception is the one who is called the Ksetrajna or the Fieldknower who must necessarily be different from the Field (Ksetra) which is the object of this knowledge It is true that at the time of perceiving an object like a pot which is different from one's body the seer who thinks 'I am a god who sees it' or 'I am a man who sees it' etc is putting himself as identical with the body through coordinate predication In the same way he experiences the body as an object of knowledge when he says 'I know this body' Thus if the body is an object of knowledge it must be different from the knowing self Therefore the Fieldknower (Ksetrajna) The knower is other than the body which is an object of knowledge like a jar etc But this knowledge which arises by way of coordinate predication is justified on the ground that the body is inseparable from oneself; for it constitutes an attribute of the self like 'cowness' of the cow etc The knowing self is however unie in being an eternal and subtle form of knowledge But this is inaccessible to the ordinary man's organs of vision; it is accessible only to a mind refined by Yoga The ignorant see the knower only in the form of Prakrti because of close proximity to or union with Prakrti Sri Krsna thus declares later on: 'When in identiciation with the Gunas he departs or stays or experiences the deluded perceive him not They who have the eye of knowledge see' ()

You should know Me to be also the Fieldsensitizer in the Fields of all The knowledge of the Field and the Fieldsensitizerthat knowledge is [in fact] the understanding of Me,And know Me also as the FieldKnower in all Fields O Arjuna The knowledge of the Field and its knower is in My view the true knowledge,And O scion of the Bharata dynasty understand Me to be the 'Knower of the field' in all the fields In My opinion that is Knowledge which is the knowlege of th field and the knower of the field,,Somewhere in the scriputures it is heard that 'The Fieldsensitizer must be worshipped' Is He the same as the Soul or the Lord or an altogether different third entity ? On a doubt regarding this problem The Bhagavat instructsIdam etc Ksetrajnam etc For persons of wordly life their body is the Ksetra 'Field' where the seeds of action grow That is why their personal Soul covered with incoming (or foreign notnatural) dirt is called Fieldsensitizer In the case of the enlightened persons the selfsame body is [again] the Ksetra But there is difference in etimological meaning viz : It decays the fetters of the result of action by means of consuming [it]; and it protects [them] from the fear of birthanddeath [cycle] With reference to these persons the Supreme Soul Vasudeva is the Fieldsensitizer He who sensitizes this Field : He who causes it to know Here the root vid includes within itself the meaning of the causal suffix ni Therefore [the meaning is :] He on account of Whose grace this insentient [body] attains the status of being sentient He alone an no one else is the Fieldsensitizer But the [only] difference is this : Taking into consideration th aspect of limited pervaisveness He is taken to be Soul; and on account of [His] unlimited pervasiveness in all the Fields [He is called] the Supreme Soul the Bhagavat Vasudeva Of Me : the Sixth Case here is in the objective sense Hence the idea is : I may be known by means of this knowledge,,,,,,"Ca api and;

matam opinion Objection: Well if it be that in all the field there exists God alone and none else other than Him as the enjoyer then God will become a mundane being; or due to the absence of any mundane creature other than God there will arise the contingency of the negation of mundance existence And both these are undesirable since the scriptures dealing with bondage Liberation and their causes will become useless and also becuase they contradict such valid means of knowledge as direct perception In the first place mundane existence which is characterized by happiness sorrow and their cause is apprehended through direct perception Besides from the perception of variety in the world it can be inferred that mundane existence results from virtue and vice All this becomes illogical if God and the individual soul be one Reply: No because this becomes justifiable owing to the difference between Knowledge and ignorance 'These two viz that which is know as Knowledge and that which is known as ignorance are widely contradictory and they follow divergent courses' (Ka ); and similarly the different results viz Liberation and enjoyment belonging (respectively) to those Knowledge and ignorance have also been pointed out to be contrary by saying that Liberation is the goal of Knowledge and enjoyment is the result of ignorance (see Ka ) Vyasa also has said so: 'Now there are these two paths' (Mbh Sa ) etc and 'There are only these two paths' etc Here (in the Gita) also two kinds of steadfastness have been stated And it is understood from the Vedas the Smrtis and reason that ignorance together with its effects has to be destroyed by Knowledge As for the Vedic texts they are: 'If one has realized here then there is truth; if he has not realized here then there is great destruction' (Ke ); 'Knowing Him in this way one becomes Immortal here' (Nr Pu ); 'There is no other path to go by' (Sv ); 'The enlightened man is not afraid of anything' (Tai ) On the other hand (the texts) with regard to the unenlightened person are: 'Then he is smitten with fear' (Tai ); 'Living in the midst of ognorance' (Ka ); One who knows Brahman becomes Brahman indeed In his line is not born anyone who does not know Brahman' (Mu ); '(While he who worships another god thinking) ""He is one and I am another"" does not know He is like an animal to the gods' (Br ) He who is a knower of the Self 'He becomes all this (Universe)' (Br ); 'When men will fold up space like (folding) leather (then) there will be cessation of sorrow without knowing the Deity' (Sv ) There are thousands of texts like these And the Smrti texts (from the Gita) are: 'Knowledge remains covered by ignorance Thery the creatures become deluded' (); 'Here itself is rirth conered by them whose minds are established on sameness' (); 'Since by seeing eally the God who is present alike everywhere (he does not injure the Self by the Self therefore he attains the supreme Goal)' () etc And as for reason there is the text 'Men avoid snakes tips of kusagrass as also well when they are aware of them Some fall into them owing to ignorance Thus see the special result arising from knowledge' (Mbh Sa ) Similarly it is known that an unelightened person who identifies himself with the body etc and who practises righteousness and unrighteousness under the impulsion of attachment and aversion takes birth and dies It cannot be reasonably denied by anyone that those who see the Self as different from the body etc become liberated as a result of the cessation of righteous and unrighteous conduct which depends on the destruction of attachment and aversion The being so the Knower of the field who is reality is God Himself appears to have become a mundane soul owing to the various adjuncts which are products of ignorance; as for instance the individual soul becomes identified with the body etc For it is a wellknown fact in the case of all creatures that their selfidentify with the body etc which are notSelf is definitely caused by ignorance Just as when a stump of a tree is firmly regarded as a man the alities of a man do not thery come to exist in the stump nor do the alities of the stump come to the person similarly the property ofconsciousness does not come to the body nor those of the body to consciousness It is not proper that the Self should be identified with happiness sorrow delusion etc since they like decrepitude and death are eally the products of ignorance Objection: May it not be said that this is not so becuase of dissimilarity? The stump and the man which are verily objects of perception are superimposed on each other through ignorance by their perceiver On the other hand in the case of the body and the Self the mutual superimposition occurs verily between a knower and an object of perception Thus the illustration is not eally applicable Therefore may it not be that the properties of the body though objects of knowledge belong to the Self which is the knower? Reply: No since there arises the contingency of (the Self) becoming devoid of consciousness! If alities such as happiness sorrow delusion desire etc of the body etc which are the field and are objects of knowledge indeed belong to the knower then it will be necessary to explain the particular reason why some of the alities of the object of knowledgethe fieldsuperimposed through ignorance belong to the Self while decrepitude death etc do not (On the contrary) it is possible to infer that they (happiness etc) do not pertain to the Self since like decrepitude etc they are superimposed on the Self through ignorance and because they are either avoidable or acceptable This being so the mundane state consisting of agentship and enjoyership pertaining to the objects of knowledge is superimposed on the knower through ignorance Hence nothing of the knower is affected theryin the same way as nothing of the sky is affected by the superimposition of surface diret etc (on it) by fools Such being the case not the least touch of the mundane state is to be apprehended with regard to the almighty [see footnote on p and p] God the Knower of the field even though He exists in all the fields For it is nowhere seen in the world that anybody is benefitted or harmed by a ality attributed to him through ignorance As for the statement that the illustration is not eally applicablethat is wrong Objection: How? Reply: Because what is intended as common between the illustration and the thing illustrated is merely the superimposition through ignorance There is no disagreement as to that However as for your contention that the illustration fails with regard to the Knower that too has been shown to be inapt by citing the example of decrepitude etc [If it be held that objects of experience may be superimposed on one another but they cannot be superimposed on the experiencer the answer is that this cannot be a universal proposition For decrepitude and death which are matters of experience are superimposed on the Self the experiencer] Objection: May it not be that the Knower of the field becomes a mundane being owing to his having ignorance? Reply: No because ignorance is of the nature of tamas Since ignorance has the nature of covering it is indeed a notion born of tamas; it makes one perceive contrarily or it arouses doubt or it leads to nonperception For it disappears with the dawn of discrimination And the three kind of ignorance viz nonperception etc [Etc: false perception and doubt] are experienced when there are such defects as blindness etc which are forms of tamas and have the nature of veiling [It is known through the process of agreement and difference that false perception etc arise from some defectsand they are not the alities of the Self] Objection: Here it is asserted that if this be the case then ignorance is a ality of the knower? Reply: No for the defects such as blindness are seen to belong to the eye which is an organ As for your notion that 'ignorance is a ality of the experiencer and the very fact of being possessed of the ality of ignorance is what constitutes the mundane state of the Knower of the field; the assertion which was made (by the Vedantin) in that connection ""that the Knower of th field is God Himself and not a mundane being "" is improper'this is not so As for example: Since such defects as false perception etc are seen to belong to the organ eye therefore false perception etc or their causes viz defects like blindness etc do not belong to the perceiver Just as blindness of the eyes does not pertain to the perceiver since on being curved through treatment it is not seen in the perceiver similarly notions like nonperception false perception doubt and their causes should in all cases pertain to some organ; not to the perceiver the Knower of the field And since they are objects of perception they are not alities of the Knower in the same way that light is of a lamp Just because they are objects of perception they are cognized as different from one's own Self Besides it is denied by all schools of thought that in Liberation when all the organs depart there is any association with such defects as ignorance etc If they (the defects) be the alities of the Self Itself the Knower of the field as heat is of fire then there can never be a dissociation from them Again since there can be no association with or dissociation from anything for the immutable formless Self which is allpervading like space therefore it is established that the Knower of the field is ever identical with God This follows alos from the utternance of the Lord 'Being without beginning and without alities' () etc Objection: Well if this be so then owing to the nonexistence of the world and the mundane creatures there will arise the defect of the uselessness of the scriptures etc Reply: No since this (defect) is admitted by all A defect that is admitted by all who believe in the Self is not to be explained by one alone! Objection: How has this been admitted by all? Reply: People of all schools of thought who believe in the Self admit that there is no worldly behaviour or the behaviour of a worldling in the liberated ones Yet in their case (ie in those various schools) it is not admitted that there is any possibility of such a defect as the scriptures becoming useless etc Similarly in our case let the scriptures be useless when the knowers of the field become identified with God; and purposeful within the sphere of ignorance This is just as in the case of all the dualists where it is admitted that the scriptures etc become useful in the state of bondage not in the state of Liberation Objection: Well for us all dualists bondage and Liberation of the Self are real in the truest sense So when things to be renounced or accepted as also the means thereto are real the scriptures etc become meaningful On the other hand may it not be that for the nondualists since duality deos not exist in truest sense it being the creation of ignorance therefore the state of bondage of the Self is not ultimately real and hence the scriptures etc become purposeless as they remain shorn of a subjectmatter? Reply: No since it is not logical that the Self should have different states If this were possible at all then the states of bondage and freedom of the Self should be simultaneous or successive As to that they cannot occur simultaneously since they are contradictorylike rest and motion in the same object Should they occur successively and without being caused then there will arise the contingency of there being no Liberation; if they occur through some cause then since they do not exist inherently there arises the contingency of their being ultimately unreal In this case also the assumption becomes falsified Moreover when ascertaining the precedence and succession of the states of bondage and Liberation the state of bondage will have to be considered as being the earlier and having no beginning but an end And that is contrary to valid means of knowledge Similarly it will have to be admitted that the state of Liberation has a beginning but no end which is certainly opposed to valid means of knowledge And it is not possible to established eternality for something that has states nd undergoes a change from one state to another On the other hand if for avoiding the defect of noneternality the different states of bondage and Liberation be not assumed then even for the dualists such defects as the purposelessness of the scriptures become certainly unavoidable Thus the situation being similar (for both) it is not for the Advaitin (alone) to refute the objection Nor do the scriptures become purposeless because the scriptures are applicable to the commonly known unenlightened person It is indeed in the case of the ignorant personnot in the case of the enlightened onethat there occurs the perception of identity of the Self with the effect (ie enjoyership) and the cause (ie agentship) which are notSelf For in the case of the enlightened persons it is impossible that after the dawn of the realization of nonidentity of the Self with effect and cause they can have Self identification with these as 'I' Surely not even a downright fool or a lunatic and such others see water and fire or shade and light as identical; what to speak of a discriminating person! Therefore such being the case the scriptures dealing with injunction and prohibition do not concern a person who sees the distinction of the Self from effect and cause For when Devadatta is ordered to do som work with the words 'You do this' Visnumitra who happens to be there does not even on hearing the ?nd conclude 'I have been ordered' But this conclusion is reasonable when the person for whom the order is meant is not understood So also with regard to cause and effect Objection: Can it not be that even after having realized the Self as different from effect and cuase it is ite reasonable from the standpoint of natural relationship [Natural relationshipSelfidentification with the body through ignorance] that with regard to the scriptures one should have the understanding 'I am enjoined to adotp the means that yields a desired result and am porhibited from adopting the means that leads to an undesirable result'? As for instance in the case of a father and son or between others even though there exists the awareness of the distinction between each other still there is the comprehension of the implication of the injunctions and prohibitions meant for one as being also meant for the other [In the (Br () we read 'Now therefore the entrusting: When a man thinks he will die he says to his son ""You are Brahman you are the sacrifice and you are the world""' etc It has been enjoined here in this manner that the son should accept as his own all the duties thus entrusted to him by the father Similarly it is understood that when a son in unable to perform his own duties the father has to accept them So also in the case of brothers and others Thus in the case of the enlightened person also though there is a comprehension of his own distinction from effect and cause still owing to his earlier relationship with ignorance body etc there is no contradiction in his understanding that the injunctions and prohibitions are meant for him] Reply: No since identification of the Self with effect and cause is possible only before attaining the knowledge of the Self as distinct (from them) It is only after one has followed (or eschewed) what is enjoined or prohibited by the scriptures that he comprehends his own distinction from the effect and cause; not before [In BS () it is said that the merit earned by the performance of scriptural duties helps to generate knowledge of Brahman Therefore these duties are not meant for the enlightened (By following what is enjoined and avoiding what is prohibited one's mind becomes purified and then only one understands he is different from cause and effectagentship and enjoyershipTr)] Therefore it is established that the scriptures dealing with injunctions and prohibitions are meant for the ignorant Objection: Well if (injunctions and prohibitions) such as 'One who desires heaven shall perform sacrifices' 'One should not eat poisoned meat' etc be not observed by those who have realized the Self as distinct and by those who view only the body as the Self then from the absence of any observer of those (injunctions etc) there would follow the uselessness of the scriptures Reply: No because engagement in or abstention from actions follows from what is ordained by the scriptures As for one who has realized the identity of the Lord and the knower of the field one who has realized Brahmanhe does not engage in action Similarly even the person who does not believe in the Self does not engage in action under the idea that the other world does not exist However one who has inferred the existence of the Self on the ground of the wellknown fact that study of the scriptures dealing with injunctions and prohibitions becomes otherwise purposeless who has no knowledge of the essential nature of the Self and in whom has arisen hankering for the results of actionshe faithfully engages in action This is a matter of direct perception to all to us Hence the scriptures are not purposeless Objection: May it not be that the scriptures will become meaningless when by noticing abstention from action in the case of men with discrimination their followers too will abstain? Reply: No because discrimination arises in some rare person only For as at present some rare one among many people comes to possess discrimination Besides fools do not follow one who has discrimination because (their) engagement in action is impelled by defects such as attachment etc And they are seen to get engaged in such acts as black magic Moreover engagement in action is natural Verily has it been said (by the Lord) 'But it is Nature that acts' () Therefore the mundane state consists of nothing but ignorance and is an object of perception (to the ignorant man who sees it) just as it appears to him Ignorance and its effects do not belong to the Knower of the feild the Absolute Moreover false knowledge cannot taint the supreme Reality For water in a mirage cannot taint the supreme Reality For water in a mirage cannot make a desert muddy with its moisture Similarly ignorance cannot act in any way on the Knower of the field Hence has this been said 'And understand Me to be knower of the field' as also 'Knowledge remains covered by ignorance' () Objection: Then what is this that even the learned say like the worldly people 'Thus [Possessed of aristorcracy etc] am I' 'This [Body wife etc] verily belongs to Me'? Reply: Listen This is that learnedness which consists in seeing the field as the Self! On the contrary should they realize the unchanging Knower of the field then they will not crave for enjoyment or action with the idea 'May this be mine' Enjoyment and action are mere perversions This being so the ignorant man engages in action owing to his desire for results On the other hand in the case of an enlightened person who has realized the changeless Self engagement in aciton in impossible because of the absence of desire for results Hence when the activities of the aggregate of body and organs cease his withdrawal from action is spoken of in a figurative sense Some may have this other kind of learnedness: 'The Knower of the field is God Himself; and the field is something different and an object of knowledge to the Knower of the field But I am a mundane being happy and sorrowful And it is my duty to bring about the cessation of worldly existence through the knowledge of the field and the Knower of the field and by continuing to dwell in His true nature after directly perceiving through meditation God the Knower of the field' and he who understands thus and he who teaches that 'he (the taught) is not the Knower of the field' and he who being under such an idea thinks 'I shall render meaningful the scriptures dealing with the worldly state and Liberation'is the meanest among the learned That Selfimmolator being devoid of any link with the traditional interpreters of the purport of the scriptures misinterprets what is enjoined in the scriptures and imagines what is not spoken there and thery himself becoming deluded befools others too Hence one who is not a knower of the traditional interpretation is to be ignored like a fool though he may be versed in all the scriptures As for the objection that if God be one with the knower of the field He will then become a mundane being and that if the knowers of the fields are one with God then from the nonexistence of mundane beings will follow the absence of the mundane state these two objections have been refuted by admitting Knowledge and ignorance as having different characteristics Objection: How? Reply: By saying that any defect imagined through ignorance does not affect the supreme Reality which is the substratum of that (imagination) In accordance with this an illustration was cited that a desert is not made muddy by water in a mirage Even the defect of the possibility of nonexistence of the mundange state conseent on the nonexistence of individual souls stands refuted by the explanation that the mundane state and the individual souls are imagined through ignorance Objection: The defect of mundane existence in the knower of the field consists in his being possessed of ignorance And sorrowfulness etc which are its products are matters of direct experience Reply: No since whatever is known is an attribute of the field therefore the knowerthe knower of the fieldcannot reasonably be tainted by the defects arising from it Whatsoever blemishnot existing in the knower of the fieldyou attribute to It is logically an object of experience and hence it is verily a ality of the field; not the ality of the knower of the field Nor does the knower of the field become tainted thery because of knower cannot possibly have any conjunction with an object of knowledge Should there be a conjunction then there will be no possibility at all of its (the latter's) becoming a knowable Oh! Sir if being ignorant sorrowful etc be alities of the Self how is it that they are directly perceived? Or how can they be alities of the Knower of the field? If the conclusion be that all that is known consititutes the field and that the one who knows is verily the knower of the field then to say that being ignorant sorrowful etcare the alities of the knower of the field and that they are directly perceived is a contradictory statement having only ignorance as its basis Here (the opponent) asks: To whom does ignorance belong? (The answer is that) it belongs verily to him by whom it is experienced! Objection: In whom is it perceived? Reply: Here the answer is: It is pointless to ask 'In whom is ignorance experienced?' Objection: How? Reply: If ignorance be perceived (by you) then you perceive its possessor as well Moreover when that possessor of ignorance is perceived it is not reasonable to ask 'In whom is it perceived?' For when an owner of cattle is seen the estion 'To whom do the cattle belong' does not become meaningful Objection: Well is not the illustration dissimilar? Since the cattle and their owner are directly perceived their relation also is directly perceived Hence the estion is meaningless Ignorance and its possessor are not directly perceived in that manner in which case the estion would have been meaningless Reply: What will it matter to you if you know the relation of ignorance with a person who is not directly perceived as possessed of ignorance? Opponent: Since ignorance is a source of evil therefore it should be got rid of Reply: He to whom ignorance belongs will get rid of it! Opponent: Indeed ignorance belongs to myself Reply: In that case you know ignorance as also yourself who possess it? Opponent: I know but not through direct perception Reply: If you know through inference then how is the connection (between yourself and ignorance) known? Surely it is not possible for you the knower to have at that time ['When you are knowing your own ignorance'] the knowledge of the relation (of the Self) with ignorance which is an object of knowledge; ['After having perceived ignorance as an object of your knowledge how can you who continue to be the knower cognize yourself as the knower of that ignorance? For this would lead to the contradiction of the same person becoming the subject and the object of cognition'] because the cognizer is then engaged in cognizing ignorance as an object Besides there cannot be someone who is a (separate) cognizer of the relation between the knower and ignorance and a separate cognition of that (relation) for this would lead to infinite regress If the knower and the relation between the knower and the thing known be cognizable then a separate cognizer has to be imagined Of him again another knower has to be imagined; of him again a separate cognizer would have to be imagined! Thus an infinite regress be comes unavoidable Again whether the knowable be ignorance or anything else a knowable is verily a knowable; similarly even a knower is surely a knower; he does not become a knowable And when this is so [Since the knower cannot be known therefore his relation with ignorance also cannot be known by himself or by anybody else] nothing of the cognizerthe knower of the fieldis tainted by such defects as ignorance sorrowfulness etc Objection: May it not be said that the (Self's) defect is surely this that the field which is full of defects is cognized (by It)? Reply: No because it is the Immutable which is consciousness by nature that is figuratively spoken of as the cognizer It is just like figuratively attributing the act of heating to fire merely because of its (natural) heat Just as it has been shown here by the Lord Himself that identification with action cause and effect are absent in the Self and that action cause etc are figuratively attributed to the Self owing to their having been superimposed (on It) through ignorance so has it been shown by Him in various places: 'He who thinks of this One as the killer৷৷' () 'While actions are being done in ever way by the gunas of Nature' () 'The Omnipresent neither accepts anybody's sin৷৷' () etc It has been explained by us too in that very way and in the following contexts also we shall explain accordingly Objection: Well in that case if identification with action cause and effect be naturally absent in the Self and it they be superimpositions through ignorance then it amounts to this that actions are meant for being undertaken only by the ignorant not by the enlightened Reply: It is true that is comes to this This very fact we shall explain under the verse 'Since it is not possible for one who holds on to a body৷৷' () And in the context dealing with the conclusion of the purport of the whole Scripture we shall explain this elaborately under the verse '৷৷in brief indeed O son of Kunti৷৷which is the supreme consummation of Knowledge' (ibid ) It is needless here to expatiate further Hence we conclude The next verse '(Hear about)৷৷what that field is' etc summarizing the purport of the chapter dealing with the 'field' taught in the verses begining from 'This body৷৷'etc is being presented For it is proper to introduce briefly the subjectmatter that is sought to be explained",,,"Know as Myself the Fieldknower also who is the only form of the Knower in all the bodies like divinities men etc ie know them as ensouled by Me By the expression 'also' (Api) in 'Know Me also (Api) as the FieldKnower' it is inferable that 'Know Me as the FieldKnower in all Fields' has also been taught by implication Just as the body on account of its being the attribute of the knower cannot exist separately and is conseently denoted by way of coordinate predication (Samanadhikarnya) with it in the same manner both the Field and the FieldKnower on account of their being My attributes cannot exist as entities separate from Me and hence can be denoted as 'one with Me' by way of coordinate predication Both the Ksetra (Field) which is an aggregate of earth etc and the Ksetrajna (the Jiva) have the Lord for their Self because of their being of the nature of the body of the Lord Such is the teaching of the Sruti passages beginning from 'He who dwelling in the earth is within the earth whom the earth does not know whose body is the earth who controls the earth from within He is your inner Controller and immortal Self' (Br U ) and ending with 'He who dwelling in the individual self as the self within whom the self does not know whose body the self is who controls the self from within He is your inner Controller and immortal Self' (Br U Madh ) It is the dwelling in of the Lord as the Self of all the knowers of the bodies (FieldKnowers or the Jivas) on account of His being the inner Controller that is the justification for describing Him as in coordinate predication (Samanadhikaranya) with them In the beginning and later on it was taught to the effect 'I am the self O Arjuna dwelling in the hearts of all beings' () and 'Nothing that moves or does not move exists without Me' () and 'I with a single aspect of Myself am sustaining the whole universe' () In the middle He describes Himself by way of coordinate predication as 'Of Adityas I am Visnu' etc In the teachings concerning the difference between the body and its knower and concerning both of them as having Me for their Self this knowledge of unity by coordinate predication alone is taught as 'My view' Some (the followers of Advaita and Bhedabheda) say: The sentence 'And know Me as the Knower' should be understood as coordinate predication expressing identity between the individual self and the Supreme Self Thus according to their view the Lord (Isvara) who is ExistenceKnowledgeBliss Absolute must be admitted to have become the individual self as it were through nescience (Ajnana) According to their docrine the teaching of identity given here in the Text seeks to sublate that nescience Just as teaching by a reliable person to the effect 'This is a rope and not a snake' sublates the erroneous notion of a snake the teaching of the Lord who is most reliable sublates the erroneous notion of the individual self (Ksetrjna) being different from Him Such interpreters are to be estioned thus: Is this Teacher Bhagavan Vasudeva the Supreme Ruler one whose nescience has been sublated by the exact knowledge of the Self or not? If His nescience has been sublated then the perception of duality like Arjuna as the taught and of actions like teaching becomes impossible because of the impossibility of superimposing a flase form on the Self which is in reality mere undifferentiated Consciousness If however His nescience has not been sublated on account of His not having realised the Self then because of His ignorance it is utterly impossible for Him to teach the knowledge of the Self Elsewhere it has been stated: 'The wise who have realised the truth will instruct you in knowledge' () Thus the polemics of this nature are to be ignored as having been set forth to misguide the world by these ignorant daters whose arguments are contradicted by all Vedas Smrtis Itihasas the Puranas logic and their own words The truth is this: Some of the Sruti texts declare that nonconscient matter the conscient entity (the individual self) and the Supreme Brahman are different in nature from one another in the relation of object of enjoyment the enjoyer (subject) and the Supreme Ruler as follows: 'From Prakrti the Possessor of Maya projects this world in which another (ie the individual self) is confined by Maya (Sve U ); 'Know then Maya to be the Prakrti and the Possessor of Maya to be the Great Lord' (Sve U ); 'The perishable is Prakrti; the immortal and imperishable is Hara (the individual self); and the Lord alone rules over both the perishable Prakrti and the imperishable individual self' (Sve U ) Here the expression 'The immortal and the imperishable is Hara' points out the enjoyer (ie individual self); It is called Hara because the individual self siezes matter as an object of It own experience Again 'He is the cause the Lord of the lord of senses' (Ibid ); 'He has no progenitor and no Lord' (Ibid ); 'He is the ruler of Prakrti of the individual self and the Lord of alities' (Ibid ); 'He is the Lord of the Universe the Ruler of individual selves the eternal the auspicious and the unchanging' (Ma Na ); 'The two unborn the knowing Lord and the unknowing individual self the omnipotent and the impotent' (Sve U); 'The Constant among inconstants the Intelligent among the intelligents the one who grants the desires of the many' (Ibid & Ka U ); 'When one knows the enjoyer the object of enjoyment and Actuater ৷৷' (Sve U ); 'Regarding the individual self and the Actuater to be different and blessed by Him It attains immortality' (Ibid ) and 'Ot these two the one eats the sweet Pippala fruit the other shines in his splendour without eating' (Ibid and Mun U ) Further 'There is one unborn female red white and black who produces many creatures like herself; there is another unborn being who loves her and is close to her; there is yet another male unborn who after having enjoyed here gives her up' (Ibid ); 'The cow (ie Prakrti) that has no beginning or end is the mother and source of all beings' (Cha U ) and 'On the selfsame tree the individual self sits sunken in grief and being ignorant and impotent It grieves When It sees the other the gracious Lord and His glory It attains freedom from grief (Sve U ) The following passages of the Gita are alos to the point: 'This Prakrti thus divided eightfold composed of Ahankara etc is Mine' 'This is My lower Prakrti Know My higher Prakrti to be distinct from this the Life Principle by which the universe is sustained (); 'All beings O Arjuna enter into My Nature at the end of a cycle These I send forth again at the beginning of a cycle Resorting to Prakrti which is My own I send forth again and again all this multitude of beings helpless under the sway of Prakrti' (); 'Under my control Prakrti gives birth to all that moves and that which does not move And because of this O Arjuna does the world spin' (); 'Know that Prakrti and the individual self are without beginning' () 'The great Brahman (or Prakrti) is My womb; in that I lay the germ; from it O Arjuna is the birth of all beings' () The great Brahman of Mine which is the womb of this world called Prakti nonconscient matter consisting of elements in a subtle state in it I lay the germ called conscient entity From that namely from the compound between conscient and unconscient entities which is willed by Me are born all these beings beginning with the gods and ending with the immobile things mixed up with the unconscient matter Such is the meaning In the Sruti also the subtle original state of material elements is signified as Brahman: 'From Him are produced Brahman as also the world of matter and soul (Anna) having name and form' (Mun U ) Likewise Sruti Texts declare that the Supreme Person constitutes the Self of all and the conscient and nonconscient entities are inseparable from Him; for those conscient and unconscient entities which abide in the form of the experiencer and the experienced abiding in all states form the body of the Supreme Person; conseently they are under His control These Texts are as follows: 'He who dwelling in the earth is within the earth whom the earth does not know whose body the earth is who is the Inner Ruler of the earth' and ending with 'He who dwelling in the self is within the self whom the self does not know whose body the self is and who is the Inner Controller of the self' (Br U Madh ) Likewise another passage declares: 'He who is moving withing the earth to whom the earth is the body whom the earth does not know ৷৷ he who is moving within the Mrtyu (Nature) to whom Mrtyu is the body whom Mrtyu does not know ৷৷ He is the Inner Self of all beings sinless; He is the divine Lord He is of the one Narayana' (Sub U ) Here the term Mrtyu denotes the subtle state of nonconscient entity which is expressed by the term Tamas because in the same Upanisad it is declared 'The unmanifest (Avyakta) merges into Aksara (the imperishable) and the Aksara merges into Tamas (Ibid ) Elsewhere it is stated thus: 'Entering within is the Ruler of all creatures the self of all (Tai A ) Therefore the Supreme Person who posseses conscient and nonconscient entities abiding in all states as His body is in the form of the world whether in the state of cause or of effect So with the purpose of making this explicit some Srutis declare that the world in its states as cause and effect is He Himself They begin with 'This Existence (Sat) alone was in the beginning one only without a second ৷৷ It thought ""May I become many may I multiply"" It creates Tejas' (Cha U ) and ends with 'All creatures here my dear have their root in the Sat (Being) have their home in the Sat have Sat as their support All this has Sat for its self That is Existence He is the Self That you are O Svetaketu' (Cha U ) Elsewhere is the following text beginning with 'He desired ""May I become many""; He performed austerity; having performed austerity He created all this' and concluding with 'He became both the Satya (individual self) and Anrta (matter) He has remained true to His nature' (Tai U ) The difference in nature between conscient and unconscient entities and the Supreme Person established in the other Sruti passages is asserted here also: 'Lo! Entering into these three divinities (ie the Tejas water and earth) in the form of living self (individual self) which is Myself I distinguish name and form? (Cha U ) and also in the text 'Having created it He entered into it Having entered it He became Sat and Tyat ৷৷ He became both conscious and unconscious both the Satya (individual self) and Anrta (matter) He has remained true to His own nature' (Tai U ) It is in this way that all the distinctions of names and forms are brought about: The Sruti also declares 'Then this was undifferentiated Now it has been differentiated by names and forms' (Br U ) Therefore He who exists in the states of effect and cause and who has the conscient and unconscient entities in their gross and subtle states as His body is the Supreme Person Because the effect is not other than the cause the effect becomes known when the cause is known when the One becomes known everything is known thus what is posited by the Srutis stands explained In the text 'Entering into these three divinities by way of living self (individual self) which is My self I distinguish name and form' (Cha U ) all the nonconscient entities are pointed out by the expression 'the three divinities' and then the distinguishing of names and forms arises on account of the individual selves having Him for Their Self entering into those entities Thus all expressive terms signify the Supreme Self who is alified by the individual selves and nonconscient matter Therefore coordinate predication (Samanadhikaranya) of a term denoting an effect with a term denoting the Supreme Self as cause is ite appropriate Thus the Supreme Brahman who has conscient and nonconscient entities in their gross and subtle conditions as His modes is Himself the effect and the cause; so Brahman is the material cause of the world Brahman Himself constitutes the material cause of the world because Brahman who has the conscient and unconscient entities in their subtle state as His body forms the cause of all Still as that material cause is a composite entity (ie of individual selves Prakrti aand Isvara) there is no mixing up of the natures of Brahman conscient entities and nonconscient entities This is perfectly tenable Thus for example although the material cause of a multicoloured cloth is a combination of white black and red threads the connection of whiteness etc with the cloth is to be found only in the place where a particular kind of thread is woven in it; in the state of effect also there is no mixing up of the colours everywhere Similarly although the world has for its material cause a combination of the Lord conscient and nonconscient entities still in its condition as an effect also there is no mixing up of the respective alities of experiencer (subject) the experienced (object) and the Controller (God) Though these threads can exist separately they are brought together at a time by man's will and acire the character and effect as a conseence But in the case of the world manifestation there is a unieness It consists in that the intelligent and insentient entities in both causal and effect conditions derive their existential nature only from and as modes of the Supreme Person by forming His body Thus the Supreme Person having those entities as His body is always signified by all these terms indicating them As for the differences in nature their respective speciality of character holds good here (ie in the production of world as of the coloured cloth) Such being the case though the Supreme Brahman enters the effect owing to absence of transformation of His nature the unchangeability is well established To signify Brahman as effect is also very appropriate because He is the Self sustaining the conscient and nonconscient entities from within their gross condition when they are differentiated by name and form: What is called effect is nothing other than the cause passing into another state of existence The various scriptural statements that the Supreme Brahman is without attributes are also tenable in the sense that He is not associated with evil attributes as the Sruti text 'He is free from evil ageless deathless sorrowless hungerless thirstless' eliminates all evil attributes and then says that He is full of auspicious attributes: 'Whose desire is real whose will is real' (Cha U ) This Sruti text itself settles here what was generally declared elsewhere that negation of attributes (Gunanisedha) pertains to evil attributes in Brahman The doctrine that Brahman is of the nature of knowledge is also ite appropriate because it amounts to saying that the true nature of Brahman who is omniscient and omnipotent who is antagonistic to all that is evil and who is the mine of all auspicious attributes can be adeately defined only as Knowledge as one whose nature is Knowledge since He possesses selfluminosity The following texts teach that Brahman is the Knower: 'He who is allknowing all wise' (Mun U ); 'His high power is revealed indeed as various and natural as consisting of knowledge strength and activity' (SveU ); 'My dear by what means has one to understand the Knower?' (Br U ); and the text 'Brahman is Existence Knowledge and Infinity' (Tai U ) All these teach that Brahman is of the nature of Knowledge in as much as He can be defined only as Knowledge and because also He is selfluminous In the texts 'He desired ""May I become many"" ' (Tai U ) 'It thought ""May I become many"" ' (Cha U ) 'It became differentiated by names and forms' it is affirmed that Brahman thus exists of His own Will in a wonderful plurality of modes on account of His having the immovable and movable entities as His body Conseently it is false to affirm the opposite view that the manifold entities do not have Brahman as their self in a real sense Thus it is the unreality of manifold existence (ie of entities without Brahman for the Self) that is denied in the following texts: 'He obtains death after death who sees difference here' (Ka U ) 'There is nothing here that is manifold' (Ka U ) 'But where there is duality as it were there one sees another ৷৷ but where everything has become the self ৷৷ there by what can one see what ৷৷ who shall know which by what?' (Br U ) There is also no denial of the manifoldness of modes of the Brahman resulting from His assumption of various names and forms by His will This is established in Sruti texts such as 'May I become manifold' (Tai U and Cha U ) etc This manifold modality is proved to be existent in the commencement of even that passage which negates multiplicity by asserting 'But where everything has become the self' (Br U ) 'Everything deserts Him who knows everything to be apart from Him' (Br U ) and 'Lo verily from this great Being has been breathed forth that which is Rg veda' (Ibid ) Thus there is no contradiction whatsoever among the Srutis which assert difference in essence and in nature between the conscient self nonconscient matter and the Lord whose body the former entities are There is no contradiction also in the scriptural statement that they are identical The relation of the body and the self exists at all times between the Lord and the conscient and nonconscient entities The Sruti texts themselves establish that those entities which constitute the body (of the Lord) acire in causal condition a subtle state in which they cannot be differentiated In the effect condition they are in a gross state with names and forms and are capable of differentiation into a multiplicity of entities as modes of the Supreme Thus there is no room whatsoever for entertaining such doctrines which ascribe nescience to Brahman (as in Advaita) for describing the differences in Brahman as due to limiting adjuncts (as in Bhedabheda) and other tenets (Yadavaprakasa's) All these proceed from unsound logic and are in viloation of all Srutis Let this overlong polemic be terminated here The object of this long polemical passage is to refute the Advaitic interpretation of the statement Know the FieldKnower in all bodies as Myself' as one of absolute identity between the Jiva and Isvara The thesis of the author of the commentary is that the relation is not oneof absolute identity but only one of identity of reference of several inseparable entities to a comon substratum known technically as Samandadhikaranya or coordinate predication also translated sometimes as grammatical coordination The literal meaning of the expression is 'the relation of abiding in a common substratum' The relation of the Jiva and Prakrti to Isvara is as of body and soul or as a mode (Prakara) and its substratum (Prakari) The relation between the body and soul of an ordinary being is however separable at death But it is inseparable in the case of Isvara and this JivacumPrakrti body In this sense Isvara is the Fieldknower (Ksetrajna) of the Field (Ksetra) constituted of all individual entities conscient and inconscient just as in each individual personality the Jiva and the body are the fieldknower and the field respectively [Being in coordinate predication (Samanadhikaranya) Brahman is an inseparable but mutually distinct complex of Prakrti Jiva and Isvara The cosmic mode of body constituted of Prakrti and Purusa is at intervals in alternate states of latency and patency (Pralaya and Srsti or dissolution and manifestation) As the soul of a complex whole He can be denoed by any of the terms entering into it Isvara Prakrti or Jiva Brahan is sometimes mentioned in the Srutis as Asat when everything is in latency in Pralaya and as Sat when all entities are in manifestations (Srsti) All these expressions denote Him only He is described in some texts as attributeless It means only that He is without any undesriable evil alities He is on the other hand endowed with countless auspicious attributes All these contentions are supported by numerous Vedic passages which are oted in the commentary]"

The param supreme unsurpassable; brahma Brahman which is under discussion as the Knowable Here some split up the phrase anadimatparam as anadi and matparam because if the word anadimat is taken as a Bahuvrihi compound ['That which has no (a) beginning (adi) is anadi' Matup is used to denote possession Since the idea of possession is a already implied in anadi therefore matup if added after it becomes redundant] then the suffix mat (matup) becomes redundant which is undesirable And they show a distintive meaning: (Brahman is anadi beginningless and is) matparam that of which I am the supreme (para) power called Vasudeva Trully the redundance could be avoided in this way if that meanig were possible But that meaning is not possible because what is intended is to make Brahman known only through a negation of all attributes by saying 'It is called neither being nor nonbeing' It is contradictory to show a possession of a distinctive power and to negate attributes Therefore although matup and a bahuvrihi compound convey the same meaning of 'possession' its (matup's) use is for completing the verse [The Commentator accepts anadimat as a nantatpurusa compund If however the Bahuvrihi is insisted on then the mat after anadi should be taken as completing the number of syllables needed for versification So nat need not be compounded with param] Having aroused an interest through inducement by saying 'The Knowable which has Immortality as its result is beeing spoken of by Me' the Lord says: Tat that Knowable; ucyate is called; na sat neither being; nor is it called asat nonbeing Objection: After strongly girding up the loins and declaring with a loud voice 'I shall speak of the Knowable' is it not incongruous to say 'That is called neither being nor nonbeing'? Reply: No What has been said is surely consistent Objection: How? Reply: For in all the Upanisads the Knowable ie Brahman has been indicated only by negation of all attributes'Not this not this' (Br ) 'Not gross not subtle' (op cit ) etc; but not as 'That is this' for It is beyond speech Objection: Is it not that a thing which cannot be expressed by the word 'being' does not exist? Likewise if the Knowable cannot be expressed by the word 'being' It does not exist And it is contradictory to say 'It is the Knowable' and 'It cannot be expressed by the word ""being""' Counterobjection: As to that no that It does not exist because It is not the object of the idea 'It is nonbeing' Objection: Do not all cognitions verily involve the idea of being or nonbeing? This being so the Knowable should either be an object of a cognition involving the idea of existence or it should be an object of a cognition involving the idea of nonexistence Reply: No because by virtue of Its being supersensuous It is not an object of cognition involving either of the two ideas Indeed any object perceivable by the senses such as pot etc can be either an object of cognition involving the idea of existence or it can be an object of cognition involving the idea of nonexistence But this Knowable being supersensuous and known from the scriptures which are the sole means of (Its) knowledge is not like pot etc an object of cognition involving either of the two ideas Therefore It is called neither being nor nonbeing As for your objection that it is contradictory to say 'It is the Knowable but it is neither called being nor nonbeing'it is not contradictory; for the Upanisad says 'That (Brahman) is surely different from the known and again It is above the unknown' (Ke ) Objection: May it not be that even the Upanisad is contradictory in its meaning? May it not be (contradictory) as it is when after beginning with the topic of a shed for a sacrifice [Cf 'Pracinavamsam karoti he constructs (ie shall construct) (the sacrificial shed) with its supporting beam turned eastward' (Tai Sam; also see SanskritEnglish Dictionary Monier Williams)Tr] it is said 'Who indeed knows whether there exists anything in the other world or not!' (Tai Sam )? Reply: No since the Upanisad speaking of something that is different from the known and the unknown is meant for establishing an entity that must be realized [The Upanisadic text is not to be rejected on the ground that it is paradoxical for it is meant to present Brahman as indentical with one's own inmost Self] But '৷৷whether there exists anything in the other world' etc is merely an arthavada [See note on p Here the passage '৷৷whether there exists৷৷' etc is to be interpreted as an arthavada emphasizing the need of raising a shed irrespective of any other considerationTr] connected with an injunction From reason who it follows that Brahman cannot be expressed by such words as being nonbeing etc For every word used for expressing an object when heard by listeners makes them understand its meaning through the comprehension of its significance with the help of genus action ality and relation; not in any other way because that is not a matter of experience To illustrate this: a cow or a horse etc (is comprehended) through genus; cooking or reading through action; white or black through ality; a rich person or an owner of cows through relation But Brahman does not belong to any genus Hence it is not expressible by words like 'being' etc; neither is It possessed of any alitity with the help of which It could be expressed through alifying words for It is free from alities; nor can It be expressed by a word implying action It being free from actionswhich accords with the Upanisadic text 'Partless actionless calm' (Sv ) Nor has It any relation since It is one nondual not an object of the senses and It is the Self Therefore it is logical that It cannot be expressed by any word And this follows from such Upanisadic texts as 'From which words trun back' (Tai ) etc Therefore it is logical that It cannot be expressed by any word And this follows from such Upanisadic texts as 'From which words turn back' (Tai ) etc Since the Knowable (Brahman) is not an object of the word or thought of 'being' there arises the apprehension of Its nonexistence Hence for dispelling that apprehension by establishing Its existence with the help of the adjuncts in the form of the organs of all creatures the Lord says:",,,I shall declare that nature of the individual self (brahman) which is the object to be known namely what is to be gained by means of virtues like modesty etc by knowing which one attains to the self which is immortal birthless free from old age death and such other material alities [The expression is split up as Anadi = beginningless; Matparam = having Me as the Highest] Anadi means that which is beginningless Indeed there is no origination for this individual self (brahman) and for the same reason It is endless The Sruti also declares: 'The wise one is not born nor dies' (Ka U ) 'Matpara' means having Me for the Highest Verily it has been told: 'Know that which is other than this (lower nature) which is the lifeprinciple to be the highest Prakrti of Mine' () By virtue of being the body of the Lord the nature of the self finds joy in being completely subsidiary to Him So the Sruti declares: 'He who dwelling in the self is within the self whom the self does not know whose body the self is and who controls the self from within ৷৷' (Br U Madh ) Similarly do the texts declare: 'He is the cause Lord of Lords and of sense organs He has no progenitor nor lord' (Sve U ); and 'He is the Lord of the Pradhana and of the individual selves and the Lord of alities (Ibid ) That which is conjoined with the ality of infinite dimension or extensiveness can be designated as brahman It is different from and not circumscribable by the body etc The meaning is It is the principle which apprehends the Ksetra Sruti also declares: 'He (ie the individual self) partakes of infinity' (Sve U ) By its Karma It is circumscribed It assumes Its infinite nature only when It is freed from the bonds of Karma The term brahman is applied to designate the individual self as in: 'He crossing beyond the Gunas' becomes fit for the sake of brahman' () 'I am the ground of the brahman who is immutable and immortal' () and 'Having attained to the state of brahman tranil he neither grieves nor craves; regarding all beings alike he attains supreme devotion to Me' () It (brahman) is said to be neither being nor nonbeing The terms 'being' and 'nonbeing' cannot signify the nature of the self because It is neither effect nor cause For It is called 'being' (Sat) in the condition of effect when It has the form of gods etc As It cannot possess names and forms in the condition of cause It is said to be 'nonbeing' or Asat So the Sruti texts declare: 'In the beginning verily this (brahman) was nonexistence; therefrom the being was born' (Tai U ) and 'Verily this (brahman) was then undifferntiated It became differentiated by names and forms' (Br U ) The self's conditions as effect and cause have arisen on account of veiling by Avidya or ignorant in the form of Karma It is not an expression of Its real nature So the terms 'being' and 'nonbeing' do not signify the nature of the self If it is argued that in the passage 'In the beginning verily this (Brahman) was nonexistence' (Tai U ) it is the Supreme Brahman in the state of cause that is described even then it can be pointed out that the Supreme Brahman in causal condition has for His body the conscient and nonconscient entities in a subtle state incapable of being differentiated by names and forms Such a description is therefore valid On the same principle the nature of Ksetra (body) and Ksetrajna (individual self) in the state of cause can also be indicated by the term 'nonbeing' But this condition of the individual self has arisen due to Karma and such descriptions as 'being' and 'nonbeing' are applicable to the self only in the state of bondage Its pure form cannot be signified by the terms 'being' and 'nonbeing'

As to this the answer is being stated: How can there be any mundane existence if there be no modification of Nature in the form of body and organs happiness and sorrow and cause and effect and there be no soul the conscious being to experience them? On the other hand there can be mundane existence when there is a contact in the form of ignorance between Naturemodified in the form of body and organs and cause and effect as an object of experience and the soul opposed to it as the experiencer Therefore it was reasonable to have said that Nature and soul become the cause of mundane existence by (respectively) becoming the originators of the body and organs and the perceiver of happiness and sorrow What again is this that is called worldly existence? Worldly existence consists in the experience of happiness and sorrow; and the state of mundane existence of the soul consists in its being the experiencer of happiness and sorrow It has been asserted that the state of mundane existence of the soul consists in its being the experiencer of happiness and sorrow How does it come about? This is being answered:,,,The 'Karya' means the body the 'Karanas' mean the instruments ie the senses of perception and action plus the Manas In their operations the Prakrti subservient to the self is alone the causal factor The sense is that their operations which are the means of experience have their foundation in the Prakrti which has developed in the form of the body subservient to the self In regard to this the authority is the aphorism 'The self is an agent on account of the scriptures having the purpose' (B S ) etc The agency of the self means that the self is the cause of the will (effort) to support the body The self (Purusa) associated with the body is the cause for experiencing pleasures and pains The meaning is that It is the seat of those experiences Thus has been explained the difference in the operations of the Prakrti and of the self when they are mutually conjoined He now proceeds to explain how though the self which in Its pristine nature experiences Itself by Itself as nothing but joy becomes the cause of experiencing both pleasure and pain derived from sense objects when It is conjoined with a body The term Guna figuratively represents effects The self (in Its pristine nature) experiences Itself by Itself as nothing buy joy But when dwelling in the body ie when It is in conjunction with the Prakrti It experiences the alities born of Prakrti namely happiness pain etc which are the effects of Gunas like Sattva etc He explains the cause of conjunction with the Prakrti:

Hence there should be three births! For destruction of acired merit is not logical to the same extent as actions that have produced the present birth and are yielding their proper results (cannot be destroyed) Besides it is not understood that actions have distinctions [Since all actions arise from ignorance they are on the same level so far so they are opposed to Knowledge; ie there can be no such distinction among actions as 'those which have started yielding results' and 'those that have not'] Therefore the actions of the three kinds without exception will produce three births or they all collectively will produce one birth Otherwise if the acired merits become destroyed it will lead to loss of faith everywhere as well as to the purposelessness of scriptures Therefore it has been illogical to say 'he will not be born again' Reply: No for the burning away of all the actions of the man of knowledge has been stated in hundreds of Upanisadic texts such as: 'And all one's actions become dissipated' (Mu ); 'Anyone who knows (that supreme) Brahman becomes Brahman' (op cit ); 'For him the delay is for so long only (as he does not become freed)' (Ch ); 'As the fibres at the tip of a blade of reed (become completely burnt৷৷' so) all actions 'get completely burnt' (op cit ) Here too the burning of all actions has been stated in 'as a blazing fire reduces pieces of wood to ashes৷৷'etc () and He will also say so (later) [See : 'I shall free you from all sins' etcTr] This accords with reason also Verily actions which arise from the seed of evils [Klesas evilssee note under Tr] like ignorance and desires germinate the sprout of rirth Here also it has been said by the Lord in various places that actions which are associated with egoism and desire for results bear fruits not the others And there is also the verse: 'As seeds burnt by fire do not germinate so also the Self does not acire another body due to evils that have been burnt by Knowledge (cf Mbh Va ) Objection: It may be granted for the present that actions performed after the rise of Knowledge are burnt by Knowledge since they coexist with Knowledge But the burning away of actions done in this life prior to the rise of Knowledge and those done in the many past lives is not reasonable Reply: No because of the alification 'all actions' () Objection: May it not be that 'all actions' means those that are undertaken after Illumination? Reply: No for there is no reason for the restriction (of the meaning) On the other hand as for the statement 'just as actions that have produced the present birth and are already active in producing their results do not get dissipated even after Illumination similarly it is not reasonable that actions which have not commenced producing their results should get dissipated'that is wrong Objection: Why? Reply: Since they have already begun producing results like an arrow that has been shot: As an arrow freed earlier from a bow for hitting a target even after piercing through the target comes to a stop only after falling down as a result of the dissipation of its initial momentum similarly actions that produced the (present) body verily continue even after fulfilling the purpose of maintaining the body to exist as before until the dissipation of their inherent tendencies But as that very arrow when it has not acired the momentum needed for action when it has not been shot even though fixed on the bow can be withdrawn similarly actions which have not begun yielding their results may be rendered unproductive by Knowledge even while existing in their receptacle [The internal organ bearing the reflection of Consciousness] Hence it is established that it has been reasonable to state that on the fall of the present body of an enlightened person 'He is not born again' Here are being presented these meditation etc which are the alternative means for the realization of the Self:,,,He who 'understands' namely knows truly with discrimination the self to be thus and also the Prakrti as having the aforesaid nature along with Sattva and other Gunas whose nature will be later examined is never born again ie is never rorn conjointly with Prakrti again in 'whatever state he may be placed' ie in whatever painful condition he may be placed in the bodies of divinities men etc The meaning is that at the time when the body ceases to exist the self will attain the purified state characterised by boundless knowledge devoid of evil

Since the Knower of the field is partless like space therefore Its conjunction with the field cannot be a kind of relationship like coming together of a rope and a pot through the contact of their parts Nor can it be an intimate and inseparable relation as between a thread and a cloth since it is not admitted that the field and the Knower of the field are mutually related by way of being cause and effect Reply: The answer is: The association of the field and the Knower of the fieldwhich are the object and the subject respectively and are of different naturesis in the form of superimposition of each on the other an also of their alities as a conseence of the absence of discrimination between the real natures of the field and the Knower of the field This is like the association of a rope nacre etc with the superimposed snake silver etc owing to the absence of discrimination between them This association of the field and the Knower of the field in the form of superimposition is described as false knowledge After having known the distinction between and the characteristics of the field and the Knower of the field according to the scriptures and having separated like a stalk from the Munjagrass the abovedescribed Knower of the field from the field whose characteristics have been shown earlier he who realizes the Knowable (ie the Knower of the field)which in accordance with 'That is neither called being nor nonbeing' () is devoid of all distinctions created by adjuncts as identical with Brahman; and he who has the firm realization that the field is surely unreal like an elephant created by magic a thing seen in a dream an imaginary city seen in the sky etc and it appears as though realfor him false knowledge becomes eradicated since it is opposed to the right knowledge described above Since the cause of his rirth has been eliminated therefore what was said in 'He who knows thus the Person and Nature along with the alities৷৷' that the man of realization is not born again () has been a reasonable statement In 'He৷৷will not be born again' () has been stated the result of right knowledge which is the absence of birth owing to the destruction of ignorance etc the seeds of worldly existence The cause of birth viz the association of the field and the Knower of the field brought about by ignorance has also been stated Hence although right knowledge which is the remover of that ignorance has been spoken of still it is being stated over again in other words:,,,Whatever being is born whether it be movable or stationary it is born only from the mutual combination of the Ksetra and Ksetrajna The sense is that it is born only from this combination ie is born as a compound of the two and never in their separateness

For all the modifications [See note on pTr] of an existing thing have as their root that modification of an existing thing described as birth All other modifications of existing things that follow birth end with destruction After destruction there is no modification of an existing thing because the object itself becomes nonexistent Indeed alities can exist so long as the thing alified exists Therefore by the reiteration of the absence of the last modification of an existing thing all its preceding modifications become negated along with their effects Hence it is established that the supreme Lord is very greatly different from all beings and is also Unconditioned [Free from all modifications that things are subject to] and One He sees who thus sees the supreme Lord as described Objection: Is it not that all poeple see? What is the need of specification? Reply: True they see; but they see contrarily! Hence the Lord specifies 'He alone sees' As in comparison with one who suffering from the (eye) disease called Timira sees many moons the person who sees one moon is distingusihed by saying 'He alone sees' similarly here as well the man who sees the one undivided Self as described above is distinguished from those who contrarily see many and differentiated selves by saying 'He alone sees' Others though seeing do not see because they see contrarily like the person who sees many moons This is the meaning The obovedescribed true knowledge has to be praised by stating its result Hence the verse begins:,,,He who sees the Atman as It really is he is the one who sees the Atman as a distinct entity in all embodied beings that are composed of Prakrti and Purusa even in bodies of diverse nature of gods men etc The true seer is one who sees the Atman as the supreme ruler in all these bodies as the imperishable self though the bodies are subject to destruction Conversely the purport is that he who sees the Atman only as characterised by the uneal forms of the bodies as men gods etc and as possessed of birth death etc such a person is perpetually caught up in transmigratory existence

Similarly it binds also jnanasangena through attachment to knowledge [Jnana derived in the sense of 'that through which one knows' means an instrument of knowledge and not Consciousness (S: Knowledge arising from the study of the import of various scriptures; or jnanam means the scriptures through which the supreme God is known and which leads to devotional practices but not to steadfastness in (the absolute) Brahman] Because of its concomitance with happiness knowledge here is an attribute of the internal organ the field but not of the Self Were it an attribute [If knowledge were a natural attribute of the Self then there can be no estion of the latter again becoming bound through association with the former] of the Self there could be no contact (between it and the Self) and 'bondage' would become illogical Association with knowledge etc should be understood in the same sense as with happiness,,,Of 'these' ie of Sattva Rajas and Tamas the characteristic nature of the Sattva is this: it illuminates on account of its being pure What is called purity is to be bereft of alities which veil light and happiness Because its nature is solely the generation of light and happiness it constitutes the cause of light and happiness 'Light' or illumination is enlightenment about a thing as it is It is 'not morbid' ie an effect called morbidity (disease) does not exist in its presence The meaning is that Sattva is the cause of health The Guna called Sattva however binds the self by attachment to happiness and knowledge The meaning is that it causes attachment to happiness and knowledge When attachment to knowledge and happiness is born one engages oneself in secular and Vedic means for securing them Conseently one is born in such bodies which constitute the means for realising such fruits Hence the Sattva binds the self through attachment to happiness and knowledge What is said is this: Sattva generates knowledge and happiness; again it generates attachment to them

and That is the root (mulam) of this world The Tree of the World which is such is urdhvamulam This accords with the Upanisadic text 'This has its roots above and branches below' (Ka ) In the Purana also we have: It sprouts from the Root in the form of the Unmanifest; it grows through the sturdiness of that very One And it has abundance of intelligence as its trunk and the appertures of the organs as the hollows The great elements are its boughs [AG takes the word visakha (boughs) in the sense of stambha perhaps meaning the aerial rootsTr]; so also it has the objects of perception as its leaves It has virtue and vice as its beautiful flowers and happiness and sorrow are the fruits it bears This eternal Tree presided over by Brahman is a means of livelihood to all creatures And this verily is the resort of Brahman [Or etat brahmavanam means: This Tree has Brahman as its object of adoration its support For the world has nothing but Brahman as its support] in it Brahman dwells for ever Having felled and split this Tree with the great sword of Knowledge and then attaining the bliss of the Self one does not return from that (bliss)' (Cf Mbh As ) That Tree which has its roots upwards and is constituted by the enchantment of mundane existence and adhahsakham which has the branches downwardsmahat [See under Tr] egoism subtle elements etc are its branches (sakhah) as it were extending downwards (adhah);

If it has limbs then there arises the contingency of Its becoming destroyed through the dismemberment of the limbs!

Asi you are; abhijatah destined to have born with the good fortune of having; daivim the divine; sampadam nature; ie you are destined for an illustrious future,,,'The divine destiny' viz which is of the nature of submission to My ?ndments aids liberation viz leads to release from bondage The meaning is that it leads to the eventual attainment of Myself 'The demoniac destiny' viz which is of the nature of transgression of My ?ndments is for bondage ie takes one to degradation To Arjuna who on hearing this became alarmed and anxious about the classfication of his own nature Sri Krsna said: 'Do not be griefridden Surely you are born for a divine destiny O son of Pandu The purport is that you have a divine destiny since you are a son of Pandu who was most eminent among the righteous

Is is Sattva Rajas or Tamas?,"""Arjuna asked: My Lord! Those who do acts of sacrifice not according to the scriptures but nevertheless with implicit faith what is their condition? Is it one of Purity of Passion or of Ignorance?",,Arjuna said Those who remain with faith but neglecting the scriptural injunction what is their state ? Is it Sattva Rajas or Tamas ? O Krsna !,Arjuna said Now what O Krsna is the position or basis of those who leave aside the injunction of the Sastra yet worship with faith? Is it Sattva Rajas or Tamas?,Arjuna said But ['But' is used to present a standpoint distinct from the earlier ones understand from S] O Krsna what is the state [ie where do the rites undertaken by them end?] of those who endued with faith adore [Adoreperform sacrifices distribute wealth etc in honour of gods and others] by ignoring the injunctions of the scriptures? Is it sattva rajas or tamas?,,Ye sastra etc The estion is this : What is the goal [to be reached] by those persons who faithfully perform their worldly actions by not adhering to the scripural injunction ? Now in this regard the answer basing on the faith is given by the Bhagavat,,,,,,Tu but; of Krsna ka what; is the nistha state; tesam of thosewhosoever they may be; ye who; being anvitah endued; sraddhaya with faith with the idea that there is something hereafter; yajante adore gods and others; utsriya by ignoring setting aside; sastravidhim the unjunctions of the scriptures the injunctions of the Vedas and the Smrtis? Is the state of those who are such sattvam sattva; aho or; rajah rajas; or tamah tamas? This is what is meant: Does the adoration of gods and others that they undertake come under the category of sattva or rajas or tamas? By 'those who endued with faith adore by ignoring the injunctions of the scriptures' are here meant those who not finding any injunction which can be characterized as 'enjoined by the Vedas' 'or enjoined by the Smrtis' worship gods and others by merely observing the conduct of their elders But on the other hand those who though aware of some scriptural injunction discard them and worship the gods and others in ways contrary to the injunctions are not meant here by 'those who ignoring scriptural injunctions adore৷৷' Why? Because of the alifying phrase 'being endued with faith' For it cannot be imagined that even when they are aware of some scriptural injunction about worship of gods and others they discard this out of their faithlessness and yet they engage in the worship of gods and others enjoined by those scriptures by becoming imbued with faith! Therefore by 'those who endued with faith adore by ignoring the injunctions of the scriptures' are here meant those very ones mentioned earlier An answer to this estion relating to a general topic cannot be given without splitting it up Hence,,,Arjuna said Those who 'filled with faith but laying aside the injunctions of the Sastras' engage themselves in sacrifices etc what is their 'position or basis'? It is Sattva Rajas or Tamas? Nistha means Sthiti What is called Sthiti is that state in which one abides has one's position or basis Do they abide in Sattva in Rajas or in Tamas? Such is the meaning of the estion Thus estioned the Lord for affirming the futility of faith and of sacrifices not enjoined in the Sastras and in order to show that the triple division in accordance with the Gunas refers only to sacrifices etc enjoined in the Sastras expounds here the threefold nature of faith enjoined in the Sastras:

Reply: No for the next adducing the reason is meant for eulogy Just as 'From renunciation immediately (follows) Peace' () is a mere eulogy of renunciation of the fruits of action it having been enjoined on Arjuna who was unenlightened and incapable of undertaking the various alternatives (paths) as stated earlier so also is this sentence 'Since it is not possible for one who holds on to a body to give up actions entirely' () meant for eulogizing the renunciation of the resorts of all actions No one can point an exception to the proposition that 'having given up all actions mentally (the embodied man of selfcontrol) continues happily৷৷without doing or causing (others) to do anything at all' (see ) Therefore these alternative veiws regarding sannyasa and tyaga are concerned only with those who are alified for rites and duties But the enlightened ones who have realized the supreme Truth are competent only for steadfastness in Knowledge which is characterized by renunciation of all actions; not for anything else Hence they do not come within the purview of the alternative veiws Thus has this been pointed out by us in connection with the text '৷৷he who knows this One as indestructible৷৷' () as also in the beginning of the third chapter,,,Some sages viz the adherents of Kapila and those Vaidikas who agree with his creed contend that all acts such as sacrifices etc should be renounced by aspirants for release as they bind even as desires and other similar defects tend to bind Other learned men say that acts like sacrifices etc should not be renounced

In reply the Lord says:,,,Regarding contradictory versions on Tyaga among disputants listen from Me My decision Tyaga has been described by Me in respect of actions prescribed by the scriptures from three points of view: () as referring to fruits () as referring to acts themselves and () as referring to agency It is contained in the statement 'Surrendering all your actions to Me with a mind focussed on the self' and 'Free from desire and selfishness and cured of fever fight' () The renunciation of fruits consists in the following manner 'Heaven and such other results arising from acts do not belong to Me' Renunciation of acts is complete abandonment of the sense of possession in regard to one's acts This sense of possession is of the following nature: 'Those acts are mine on account of their being the means for fruits which are to be mine' Renunciation referring to agency is the renunciation of agency of oneself by ascribing the agency to the Lord of all

(Reply:) This is wrong since it has been established by the text 'sacrifice charity and austerity are verily the purifiers' that even the nityakarmas have results For a seeker of Liberation who wants to give up even the nityakarmas from fear of their being causes of bondage how can there be any association with actions done for desired results? Moreover the phrase etani api cannot apply to actions done for desired results (kamyakarmas) since they have been denigrated in '৷৷indeed actions is ite inferior' () and in '৷৷by actions other than that action meant for God' () and since on the strength of the texts [Which support the two earlier arguments] 'the Vedas have the three alities as their object' () 'Those who are versed in the Vedas who are drinkers of Soma৷৷(pray for the heavenly goal by worshipping) Me' () and 'they enter into the human world on the exhaustion of their merit' () it has been definitely stated that actions done for desired results are causes of bondage; and also because they are far removed from the context,,,Since sacrifices gifts austerities etc are the means for the purification of the wise therefore it is My decided and final view that they should be performed as a part of my worship until one's death renouncing attachment viz possessiveness towards actions and their fruits

As regards this the renunciation based on tamas and rajas have been stated Why is the relinishment of attachment and (desire for their) results spoken of here as the third? This is like somody saying 'Three Brahmanas have come Of them two are versed in the six auxiliaries [The six auxiliaries are: Siksa (Phonetics) Kalpa (Code of Rituals and Sacrifices) Vyakarana (Grammar) Nirukta (Etymology) Chandas (Meter Prosody) and Jyotisa (Astronomy)Tr] of the Vedas; the third is a Ksatirya!' Reply: This is not wrong for this is meant as a eulogy on the basis of the common factor of renunciation Between renunciation of actions and renunciation of hankering for results there is indeed the similarity of the fact of renunciation While on this subject by condemning 'renunciation of actions' on account of its being based on rajas and tamas the 'renunciation of desire for results of actions' is being praised on account of its being based on sattva by saying 'that renunciation is considered to be based on sattva' The internal organ of a person who is alified for rites and duties who performs the nityakarmas by giving up attachment and hankering for results becomes pure on account of its being untainted by attachment to results etc and refined by the nityakarmas When it is pure and tranil it becomes capable of contemplating on the Self Since for that very person whose internal organ has become purified by performing the nityakarmas and who has become ready for the knowledge of the Self the process by which he can become steadfast in it has to be stated therefore the Lord says:,,,When rites like obligatory and occasional ceremonies and the great sacrifices enjoined on one's station and stage in life are practised for their own sake as worship of Myself and as a duty relinishing possessiveness and fruits such abandonment is regarded as Sattvika It is noted in Sattva The idea is that it is rooted in the knowledge of the meaning of the Sastras as it really is That Sattva generates the knowledge of things as they really are has been taught in: 'From Sattva arises knowledge' () and it will be further declared: 'That reason by which one knows action and renunciation what ought to be done and what ought not to be done fear and fearlessness bondage and release O Arjuna is Sattvika' ()

yastu karmaphalatyāgī sa tyāgītyabhidhīyate ||18-11||",,Verily it is not possible for an embodied being to abandon actions entirely; but he who relinishes the rewards of actions is verily called a man of renunciation,But since those still in the body cannot entirely avoid action in their case abandonment of the fruit of action is considered as complete renunciation,,Indeed to relinish actions entirely is not possible for a bodybearing one; but whosoever relinishes the fruits of actions he is said to be a man of [true] relinishment,For it is impossible for one who bears a body to abandon actions entirely But he who gives up the fruits of works is called the abandoner,Since it is not possible for one who holds on to a body to give up actions entirely therefore he on the other hand who renounces results on actions is called a man of renunciation,,Niscayam etc upto abhidhiyate The conclusion here is this : Due to the manifoldness of the nature of the Strands that have been defined earlier the act of relinishment itself is performed with a certain mental disposition which is a modification of the Sattva the Rajas and the Tamas (the Strands) Because it reflects (is contaminated by) the nature of the person having the same (the said mental dispositon) what is called the real (unalloyed) relinishment is the performance of the actions by the knowers of the Supreme Brahman by giving up desire to achieve fruits and by avoiding the craving and hatred on account of their eanimity to [the pairs of opposites like] success and failure etc That is why [the Bhagavat] says : 'By the act of relinishment born of the Rajas or of the Tamas (Strands) no connection with the fruit [of relinishment] is attained' However for an act of relinishing born of the Sattva (Strand) there is the fruit in the form of honouring the purport of the scriptures The application of the term 'relinishment' stands to reason in fact only in the case of a sage who has relinished his holding on the multitude of the Strands,,,,,,Dehabhrta for one who holds on to a bodyone who maintains (bibharti) a body (deha) is called a dehabhrt One who has selfindentification with the body is called a dehabhrt but not a so a man of discrimination; for he has been excluded from the eligibility for agentship by such texts as 'He who knows this One is indestructible৷৷' etc Hence for that unenlightened person who holds on to the body he since; it is na not; sakyam possible; tyaktum to give up renounce; karmani actions; asesatah entirely totally; therefore the ignorant person who is competent (for rites and duties) yah who; tu on the other hand; karmaphalatyagi renounces results of actions relinishes only the hankering for the results of actions while performing the nityakarmas; sah he; is abhidhiyate called; tyagi iti a man of renunciationeven though he continues to be a man of rites and duties This is said by way of eulogy Therefore total renunciation of actions is possible only for one who has realized the supreme Truth who does not hold on to the body and who is devoid of the idea that the body is the Self Again what is that purpose which is accomplished through renunciation of all actions? This is being stated:,,,"It is impossible for one who has a body and has to nourish it 'to abandon action entirely'; for eating drinking etc reired for nourshing the body and other acts connected therewith are unavoidable And for the same reason the five great sacrifices etc are also indispensable He who has given up the fruits of the five great sacrifices is said to have renounced; this is referred to in the Srutis such as: 'Only through renunciation do some obtain immortality' (Ma Na ) Renunciation of fruits of actions is illustrative; it implies much more It implies one who has renounced the fruits agency and attachment to works as the topic has been begun with the declaration: 'For abandonment (Tyaga) is declard to be of three kinds' () This statement may be estioned in the following manner: 'Agnihotra the full moon and new moon sacrifices Jyotistoma etc and also the five great sacrifices are enjoined by the Sastras only for the attainment of their results like heaven They are not purposeless Even the injunction with regard to obligatory and occasional ceremonies is enjoined because they yield results as implied in the following passage: ""For householders Prajapatya ceremony"" (VP ) Therefore as the performance of actions has to be understood as a means for attaining their respective results the accruing of agreeable and disagreeable results is inevitable even though they are performed without any desire for fruits just as a seed sown must grow into a tree and bear fruit Hence actions ought not to be performed by an aspirant for release because the results are incompatible with release Sri Krsna answers such objections:"

phalam results; karmanah of actions characterized as the righteous and the unritheous; anistam the undesirable consisting in (birth in) hell (among) animals etc; istam the desirable consisting in (birth as) gods and others;

atyaginam to those who do not resort to renunciation to the unilllumined the men with rites and duties who are not men of renunciation in the truest sense The derivative sense of the word phala (phala) is this: On accunt of being accomplished through the operation of diverse external accessories and a result of ignorance comparable to the charm cast by jugglery a source of great delusion and appearing as though close to the indwelling Self it is phalgu (unsubstantial) and as a conseence it undergoes layam (disappearance) (The result that is of this kind accrues to those who do not resort to renunciation) Tu but; na kvacit never; sannyasinam to those who resort tomonasticism for the sake of the highest Reality to the class of monks called paramahamsas who remain steadfast in Knowledge alone For it cannot be that those who are devoted wholly to steadfastness in complete enlightenment do not dig out the seed of transmigration This is the meaning Therefore it is only for those who have realized the supreme Truth that it is possible to become a monk who renounces actions totally because action accessories and results are superimmpositions on the Self through ignorance But the renunciation of all actions is not possible for an unenlightened person who perceives the locus (the body etc) action agentship and accessories as the Self This the Lord shows in the following verses:,,,The 'undesirable result' is Naraka etc 'the desirable' is heaven etc 'the mixed' is sons cows food etc which are combined with some undesirable results Those who have not renounced namely those who are devoid of renunciation of agency possessiveness and fruits they meet with threefold conseences after death The meaning of 'after death' (Pretya) may be understood as subseent to the performance of actions But 'to those who have renounced none whatsoever' viz to those who have relinished the sense of agency etc no such results antagonistic to release accrue Here the purport is this: Agnihotra the great sacrifices etc are obligatory throughout life and are reired for attaining the objects of desire; but in regard to release their application is different Though externally they appear to be the same in their nature in both the conditions they are different in their fruits by virtue of difference in application Their application to release is seen in such texts as 'The Brahmanas desire to know Him by the study of the Vedas by sacrifices by gifts by austerities conjoined with fasting' (Br U ) Here the performance of actions without sense of agency is enforced Such giving up agency etc are relevant only with regard to acts that are actually performed Thus Sannyasa or renouncing of this kind is established in the Sastras The same is also called Tyaga or giving up Sri Krsna now explains the manner of realising that one is nonagent by attributing all agency to God who is the Supreme Person and the Inner Ruler By cultivating this attitude an aspirant can attain the renunciation of possessiveness with regard to actions and also their fruits For it is the Supreme Person who performs all actions through the individual selves who belong to Him The organs bodies and Pranas of embodied beings are His They exist for the sake of His own sport as the only purpose Therefore even the appeasement of hunger etc and such other acts which affect the life of the individual souls and their works constitute only the means for accomplishing that purpose namely the sport of the Highest Purusa Himself The purport of the argument is this: The analogy of seeds producing the tree and its fruits is not applicable to the actions of releaseseekers Their actions may look like those of fruitseekers externally But as mentally they do not entertain any such purpose the conseence of their actions can be ite different The purpose served by their actions is only affording sport for the Supreme Being

Reply: There is not such fault because the Self being changeless by nature there is no possiblity of Its becoming united with the locus etc For it is only a changeful entity that can possibly be united with another or come to have agentship through combination But for the changeless Self there can be no combination with anything whatsoever Hence agentship through combination is not logical Therefore the absoluteness of the Self being natural the word kevalam is merely a reiteration of an established fact And the changelessness of the Self is well known from the Upanisads the Smrtis and logic As to that in the Gita itself this has been established more than once in such texts as 'It is said that৷৷This is unchangeable' () 'Actions are being done by the gunas themselves' (see ) 'this ৷৷supreme Self does not act৷৷although existing in the body' () and in the Upanisads also in such texts as 'It thinks as it were and shakes as it were' (Br ) And from the standpoint of reason also the royal path is to hold that the true nature of the Self is that It is partless independent of others and changeless Even if mutability (of the Self) be accepted It should have a change that is Its own The functions of the locus etc cannot be attributed to the agency of the Self Indeed an action done by someone else cannot be imputed to another by whom it has not been done! As for what is imputed (on somody) through ignorance that is not his As the ality of silver is not of nacre or as surface or dirt attributed through ignorance to the sky by foolish people is not of the sky similarly the changes in the locus etc also are verily their own and not of the Self Hence it has been well said that the enlightened person 'does not kill nor is he bound' becuase of the absence of his being tainted by the idea that actions are done by himself [Some translate this portion thus: '৷৷because of the absence of the thought 'I am doing' and also due to the taintlessness of the mind'; or '৷৷in the absence of egotism and of all taint in the mind'Tr] After having declared 'This One does not kill nor is It killed' (); having stated the immutability of the Self through such texts as 'Never is this One born' () etc which adduce the reason for this; having briefly stated at the commencement of the Scripturein 'he who knows this One as indestructible' ()that the enlightened man has no eligibility for rites and duties; and having deliberated in various places on that (cessation) which has been mooted in the middle (of the Scripture) the Lord by way of summarizing the purport of the Scripture concludes here by saying that the enlightened person 'does not kill nor does he become bound' If this be so then it becomes established that the three kinds of results of actions viz the undesirable etc do not accrue to the monks since it is reasonable that because of the illogicality of their entertaining the idea of being embodied all actions resulting from ignorance become abandoned (by them) And hence as a conseence of a reversal of this it becomes inevitable that the results do accrue to others Thus this is how the purport of the scripture Gita has been summed up In order that this which is the essence of the teachings of all the Vedas should be understood after deliberation by the learned ones possessing a sharp intellect it has been explained by us in accordance with the scriptures and reasoning in various places by dealing with it topically Thereafter now is being stated what promts actions:",,,He who through the contemplation of the agency of the Supreme Being is free from the selfconceit 'I alone do everything'; he whose understanding is not therefore tainted and has come to be informed by the understanding; 'As I am not the agent of this work its fruit is not connected with me; so this work does not belong to me' such a person though he slays all these men not merely Bhisma etc does not slay them Therefore he is not bound by the actions known as battle The meaning is that the fruits of such actions do not accrue to him Sri Krsna now teaches how action is induced For this he differentiates actions generated by Sattva and the other Gunas The object is to inculcate the desirability of the Sattvika type For only meditation on the self not being the agent brings about the growth of Sattva

Counterobjection: What follows from this? Opponent: If it be that the duty to which one is born should not be renounced because it is impossible to relinish it totally then the conclusion that can be arrived at is that complete renunciation (of duty) is surely meritorious! Counterobjection: Truly so But may it not be that total relinishment is itself an impossibility? Is a person everchangeful like the gunas of the Sankhyas or is it that action itself is the agent as it is in the case of the momentary five [Rupa (from) vedana (feeling) vijnana (momentary consciousness) sanjna (notion) samskara (mental impressions)these have only momentary existence In their case there can be no distinction between action and agent simply due to the fact of their being momentary] forms of mundane consciousness propounded by the Buddhists? In either case there can be no complete renunciation of action Then there is also a third standpoint (as held by the Vaisesikas): When a thing acts it is active and inactive when that very thing does not act If this be the case here it is possible to entirely give up actions But the speciality of the third point of view is that a thing is not everchanging nor is action itself the agent What then? A nonexistent action originates in an existing thing and an existing action gets destroyed The thinginitself continues to exist along with its power (to act) and that itself is the agent This is what the followers of Kanada say [Their view is that agentship consists in 'possessing the power to act' not in being the substratum of action] What is wrong with this point of view Vedantin: The defect indeed lies in this that this veiw is not in accord with the Lord's view Objection: How is this known? Vedantin: Since the Lord as said 'Of the unreal there is no being৷৷' etc () The view of the followers of Kanada is indeed this that the nonexistent becomes existent and the existent becomes nonexistent Objection: What defect can there be if it be that this view even though not the view of the Lord yet conforms to reason? Vedantin: The answer is: This is surely faulty since it contradicts all valid evidence Objection: How? Vedantin: As to this if things like a dvyanuka (dyad of two anus atoms) be absolutely nonexistent before origination and after origination continue for a little while and again become absolutely nonexistent then in that acase the existent which was verily nonexistent comes into being [Here Ast adds 'sadeva asattvam apadyate that which is verily existent becomes nonexistent'Tr] a nonentity becomes an entity and an entity becomes a nonentity! If this be the view then the nonenity that is to take birth is comparable to the horns of a hare before it is born and it comes into being with the help of what are called material (inherent) nonmateial (noninherent) and efficient causes But it cannot be said that nonexistence has origination in this way or that it depends on some cause since this is not seen in the case of nonexistent things like horns of a hare etc If such things as pot etc which are being produced be of the nature of (potentially) existing things then it can be accepted that they originate by depending on some cause which merely manifests them [According to Vedanta before origination a thing eg a pot remains latent in its material cause clay for instance with its name and form unexpressed and it depends on other causes for the manifestation of name and form] Moreover if the nonexistent becomes existent and the existent becomes nonexistent then nobody will have any faith while dealing with any of the means of valid knowledge objects of such knowledge because the conviction will be lacking that the existent is existent and the nonexistent is nonexistent! Further when they speak of origination they (the Viasesikas) hold that such a thing as a dvyanuka (dyad) comes to have relationship with its own (material) causes (the two atoms) and existence and that it is nonexistent before origination; but later on depending on the operation of its own causes it becomes connected with its own causes viz the atoms as also with existence through the inherent (or inseparable) relationship called samavaya After becoming connected it becomes an existent thing by its inherent relationship with its causes [The effect (dyad) has inherent relationship with existence after its material causes (the two atoms) come into association] It has to be stated in this regard as to how the nonexistent can have an existent as its cuase or have relationship with anything For nobody can establish through any valid means of knowledge that a son of a barren woman can have any existence or relationship or cause Vaisesika: Is it not that relationship of a nonexistent thing is not at all established by the Vaisesikas? Indeed what is said by them is that only existent entities like dvyanuka etc have the relationship in the form of samavaya with their own causes Vedantin: No for it is not admitted (by them) that anything has existence before the (samavaya) relationship (occurs) It is surely not held by the Vaisesikas that a pot etc have any existence before the potter (his) stick wheel etc start functioning Nor do they admit that clay itself takes the shape of a pot etc As a result it has to be admitted (by them) as the last aternative that nonexistence itself has some relationship! Vaisesika: Well it is not contradictory even for a nonexistent thing to have the relationship in the form of inherence Vedantin: No because this is not seen in the case of a son of a barren woman etc If the antecedent nonexistence (pragabhava) of the pot etc alone comes into a relationship with its own (material) cause but not so the nonexistence of the son of a barren woman etc though as nonexistence both are the same then the distinction between the (two) nonexistences has to be explained Through such descriptions ( of abhava nonexistence) as nonexistence of one nonexistence of two nonexistence of all antecedent nonexistence nonexistence after destruction mutual nonexistence and absolute nonexistence nobody can show any distinction (as regards nonexistence itself)! There being no distinction (therefore to say that:) 'it is only the ""antecedent nonexistence"" of the pot which takes the form of the pot through the (action of) the potter and others and comes into a relationship with the existing pothalves which are its own (material) causes and becomes fit for all empirical processes [Such as production destruction etc] but the ""nonexistence after destruction"" of that very pot does not do so though it too is nonexistence Hence the ""nonexistence after destruction"" etc [Etc stands for 'mutual nonexistence (anyonyaabhava)' and 'absolute nonexistence (atyantaabhava)'] are not fit for any empirical processes whereas only the ""antecedent nonexistence"" of things called dvyanuka etc is fit for such empirical processes as origination etc'all this is incongruous since as nonexistence it is indistinguishable as are 'absolute nonexistence' and 'nonexistence after destruction' Vaisesika: Well it is not at all said by us that the 'antecedent nonexistence' becomes existent Vedantin: In that case the existent itself becomes existent as for instance a pot's becoming a pot or a cloth's becoming a cloth This too like nonexistence becoming existent goes against valid evidence Even the theory of transformation held by the Sankhyas does not differ from the standpoint of the Vaisesikas since they believe in the origination of some new attribute [ie in the origination of a transformation that did not exist before] and its destruction Even if manifestation and disappearance of anything be accepted yet there will be contradiction with valid means of knowledge as before in the explanation of existence or nonexistence of manifestation and disappearance Hery is also refuted the idea that origination etc (of an effect) are merely particular states of its cuase As thelast alternative it is only the one entity called Existence that is imagined variously through ignorance to be possessed of the states of origination destruction etc like an actor (on a stage) This veiw of the Lord has been stated in the verse 'Of the unreal there is no being৷৷' () For the idea of existence is constant while the others are inconstant Objection: If the Self be immutable then how does the 'renunciation of all actions' become illogical? Vedantin: If the adjuncts (ie body and organs) be real or imagined through ignorance in either case action which is their attribute is surely superimposed on the Self through ignorance From this point of view it has been said that an unenlightened person is incapable of totally renouncing actions even for a moment (cf ) The enlightened person on the other hand can indeed totally renounce actions when ignorance has been dispelled through Illumination; for it is illogical that there can (then) remain any trace of what has been superimposed through ignorance Indeed no trace remains of the two moons etc superimposed by the vision affected by (the disease called) Timira when the desease is cured This being so the utterance 'having given up all actions mentally' () etc as also 'Being devoted to his own duty' () and 'A human being achieves 'success by adoring Him through his own duties () becomes justifiable What was verily spoken of as the success arising from Karma (yoga) characterized as the fitness for steadfastness in Knowledgethe fruit of that (fitness) characterized as 'steadfastness in Knowledge' consisting in the perfection in the form of the state of one (ie a monk) free from duties has to be stated Hence the (following) verse is begun:",,,So one should not relinish one's works understanding that they are natural are easy to perform and not liable to negligence Such thoughts coupled with the idea that there are imperfections in them should not lead you to abandon them The meaning is that though one is fit for Jnana Yoga one should perform Karma Yoga only All enterprises be they of Karma or Jnana are indeed enveloped by imperfections by pain as fire by smoke But still there is this difference: Karma Yoga is easy and does not involve negligence but Jnana Yoga is contrary to this

Objection: No because those sentences are meant for refuting the idea that the Self is of the nature of darkness When the Self is denied of possessing forms of substance ality etc the contingency arises of the Self's being of the nature of darkness The sentences 'radiant like the sun' etc are meant for ruting this And this follows from the specific denial of from by saying 'Formless' (Ka ) and from such texts as 'His form does not exist within the range of vision; nobody sees Him with the eye' (Ka : Sv ) 'soundless touchless' (ka ) etc which show that the Self is not an object of perception Therefore it remains unproved that there can be any knowledge which takes the form of the Self How then can there be the knowledge of the Self? For all knowledge that there can be with regard to objects assumes their respective forms And it has been said that the Self has no form Moreover if both knowledge and the Self be formless then how can there be the consummation [Firmness in Selfrealization] of the (repeated) contemplation on that (knowledge of the Self)? Vedantin: No Since it can be established that the Self is supremely taintless pure and subtle and it can also be established that the intellect can have taintlessness etc like the Self therefore it stands to reason that the intellect can take a form resembling the consciousness of the Self The mind becomes impressed with the semblance of the intellect; the organs become impressed with the semblance of the mind; and the body becomes impressed with the semblance of hte organs Hence it is that the idea of the body itself being the Self is held by ordinary people The Lokayatikas (materialists) who hold that the body is identical with consciousness say that a person is a body endowed with consciousness; so also there are others who say that the organs are identical with consciousness; there are others who say that the mind is identical with consciousness and still others who say that the intellect is identical with consciousness Some accept as the Self the Unmanifest [The inmost Ruler (antaryamin) possessing a semblance of Consciousness] called the Undifferentiated which is more internal than that (intellect) and is within the domain of (primordial) ignorance Indeed in every case beginning from the intellect to the body the cause of misconceived Selfhood is the semblance of the Consciousness that is the Self Hence knowledge about the Self is not a subject for injunction What then? Only the eradication of the superimposition of name form etc which are not the Self is what has to be undertaken but not the knowledge of the Self that is Consciousness For it is the Self which is experienced as possessed of the forms of all the various objects that are superimposed (on It) through ignorance It is evidently because of this that the Buddhists who uphold the view of (momentary) consciousness have concluded that there is no substance at all apart from (momentary) consciousness and that it is not in need of any other valid proof since they hold that it is selfcognized Therefore what is to be undertaken is only the elimination of the superimposition on Brahman through ignorance but no effort is needed for knowing Brahman (Consciousness) for It is ite selfevident! It is because the intellect is distracted by particular appearances of name and form imagined through ignorance that Brahman even though selfevident easily realizable nearer than all else and identical with oneself appears to be concealed difficult to realize very far and different But to those whose intellect has become free from external appearances and who have obtained the grace of a teacher and serenity of mind there is nothing more blissful manifest well known easily realized and nearer to oneself than this Self And thus it has been declared 'directly realizable righteous' etc () However some wiseacres assert that the intellect cannot comprehend the entity called the Self since It is formless; hence complete steadfastness in Knowledge is impossible This is truly so for those who have not associated with a traditional line of teachers; who have not heard the Upanisads; whose intellects are too much engrossed with external objects; and who have not applied themselves diligently to the perfect means of knowledge For those on the other hand who are the opposite of these it is absolutely impossible to have the idea of reality with regard to empirical objects which are within the realm of duality involving the knower and the known because in their case there is no perception of any other thing apart from the Consciousness that is the Self We have already said how this is certainly so and not otherwise It has been stated by the Lord also 'That during which creatures keep awake it is night to the seeing sage' () Therefore the cessation of the perception of differences in the form of external things is alone the cause of resting in the reality of the Self For that which is called the Self is never an object which is not well known attainable rejectable or acceptable to anyone at any time Were that Self to be indeed not selfevident all activities would become meaningless [According to Ast the latter portion of this sentence is: svarthah sarvah pravrttayah vyarthah prasajyeran all activities meant for one's own benefit would become meaninglessTr] For it cannot be imagined that they could be undertaken for unconscious objects like the body etc Besides it cannot be that pleasure is for pleasure's sake or that sorrow is for sorrow's sake Moreover all empirical dealings are meant for culminating in the realization of the Self [According to BS 'On the strength of the Upanisadic sanction of sacrifices etc all religious activities as well are necessary৷৷' sacrifices etc are meant for leading to the realization of the Self without which they would become meaningless] Therefore just as for knowing one's own body there is no need of any other (external) means of knowledge so also there is no need of any other means of knowledge for the realization of the Self which is innermost (in relation to the body etc) Hence it is established that steadfastness in the knowledge of the Self is a fact very well known to the discriminating people Even to those who hold that knowledge is formless and not cognized by direct perception cognition of an object is dependent on knowledge Hence it has to be admitted that knowledge is as immediate as pleasure etc And this follows also from the impossibility of a desire to know (knowledge) Had knowledge been not selfevident it could have been sought for like any object of knowledge And in that case as [This is Ast's reading; others read tathaTr] a knower seeks to perceive through knowledge such objects of knowledge as pot etc similarly the knower would have sought to perceive knowledge through another knowledge! But this is not the case Therefore knowledge is ite selfrevealing and for the very same reason the knower also is selfrevealed Hence effort is not needed for knowledge but only for the removal of the notion of what is notSelf [In place of anatmabuddhinivrttau Ast has 'anatmani atmabuddhinivrttau for the termination of thinking what is not the Self as the Self'Tr] Conseently steadfastness in Knowledge is easy of accomplishment It is being stated how this supreme consummation of Knowledge is to be attained:,,,One who has attained 'perfection' viz one who has attained perfection in meditation generated by the Karma Yoga performed day after day till death how in what way he attains the brahman learn this from Me in brief It is the same Brahman who is described as the supreme consummation of knowledge The meaning is that the self is the supreme consummation the supreme end of knowledge which is of the nature of meditation

Vedantin: If it be asked How it is contradictory? Opponent: The answer is: Whenever any Knowledge of something arises in a knower at that very moment the knower knows that object Hence he does not depend on steadfastness in Knowledge which consists in the repetition of the act of knowing And therefore it is contradictory to say one knows not through knowledge but through steadfastness in knowledge which is a repetition of the act of knowing Vedantin: There is no such fault since the culmination of Knowledgewhich (Knowledge) is associated with the causes of its unfoldment and maturity and which has nothing to contradict it in the conviction that one's own Self has been realized is what is referred to by the word nistha (consummation): When knowledgewhich concerns the identity of the 'Knower of the field' and the supreme Self and which remains associated with the renunciation of all actions that arise from the perception of the distinction among their accessories such as agent etc and which unfolds from the instruction of the scriptures and teachers depending on purity of the intellect etc and humility etc which are the auxiliary cuases of the origin and maturity of Knowledgecontinues in the form of the conviction that one's own Self has been realized then that continuance is called the supreme steadfastness (nistha) in Knowledge This steadfastness in Knowledge that is such has been spoken of as the highest the fourth kind of devotion in relation to the three other devotions viz of the afflicted etc (cf ) Through that highest devotion one realizes the Lord in truth Immediately after that the idea of difference between the Lord and the Knower of the field vanishes totally Therefore the statement 'one knows Me through devotion in the form of steadfastness in Knowledge' is not contradictory And in this sense all the scripturesconsisting of Vedanta (Upanisads etc) History Mythology and Smrtis as for instance 'Knowing (this very Self the Brahmanas) renounce৷৷and lead a mendicant's life' (Br ) 'Therefore they speak of monasticism as excellent among these austerities' (Ma Na ) 'Monasticism verily became supreme' (ibid ) which enjoin renunciation become meaningful Thus monasticism means renunciation of rites and duties There are also the texts 'Having renounced the Vedas as well as this world and the next' (Ap Dh Su ) and 'Give up religion and irreligion' (Mbh Sa ; ) etc And here (in the Gita) also various relevant) passages have been pointed out In is not porper that those texts should be meaningless Nor are they merely eulogistic since they occur in their own contexts Besides Liberation consists in being established in the changeless real nature of the indwelling Self Indeed it is not possible that one who wants to go to the eastern sea and the other who wants to go in the opposite direction to the western sea can have the same course! And steadfastness in Knowledg consists in being totally absorbed in maintaining a current of thought with regard to the indwelling Self And that is opposed to coexistence with duties like going to the western sea It has been the conclusion of those versed in the valid means of knowledge that the difference between them is as wide as that between a mountain and a mustard seed! Therefore it is established that one should have recourse to steadfastness in Knowledge only by relinishing all rites and duties The fruit of the attainment of success from the Yoga of Devotion consisting in worshiping the Lord with one's own actions is the ability to remain steadfast in Knowledge from which follows steadfastness in Knowledge culminating in the result Liberation That Yoga of Devotion to the Lord is now being praised in this concluding section dealing with the purport of the Scripture with a veiw to generating a firm conviction with regard to it (the purport of the Scripture):",,,Through such devotion he knows 'who I am' ie knows My own essence and My nature and 'what I am' ie in My attributes and glory Knowing Me truly he rises to a higher level than this Bhakti and aciring knowledge of the truth enters into Me through devotion The meaning is that he attains Me by means of infinite and unsurpassed Bhakti which develops subseent in time to the vision of the nature attributes and glory of the Lord in reality Here the term 'Tatah' (through) denotes that devotion is the cause of attainment; for it has been stated to be the cause of entrance n the text 'But by singelminded devotion it is possible ৷৷' () In this way the crowning development has been told starting from the disinterested performance of periodical and occasional rites suitable for the various stations and stages of life which are to be performed to propitiate the Supreme Person Sri Krsna now explains that even for actions meant for attaining desired objects (Kamyakarmas) the crowning stage is the same as for these described above provided they too are done not for fulfilling one's desires but as offerings to propitiate the Supreme Person

Why does the doubt arise? (Because) the passages like '৷৷by realizing which one attains Immortality' () 'Then having known Me in truth he enters (into Me) immediately after that (Knowledge)' () etc point to the attainment of Liberation through Knowledge alone Texts like 'Your right is for action alone' () '(you undertake) action itself () etc show that actions have to be undertaken as a matter of compulsory duty Since both Knowledge and action are thus enjoined as duties therefore the doubt may arise that they in combination as well may become the cause of Liberation Objection: What again would be the result of this iniry? Vedantin: Well the resut will verily be this: The ascertainment of one of these as the cuase of the highest good Hence this has to be investigated more extensively Knowledge of the Self however is exclusively the cause of the highest good; for through the removal of the idea of differences it culminates in the result that is Liberation The idea of distinction among action agent and result is ever active with regard to the Self because of ignorance This ignorance in the form 'My work; I am the agent; I shall do this work for that resut' has been at work from time without beginning The dispeller of this ignorance is this Knowledge regarding the Selfin the form 'I am the absolute non agent free from action and result; there is none else other than myself because when it (Knowledge) arises it despels the idea of differences which is the cause of engagement in action The word 'however' above is used for ruling out the other two alternatives This refutes the two other alternative views by showing that the highest good cannot be attained through mere actions nor by a combination of Knowledge and action Besides since Liberation is not a product therefore it is illogical that it should have action as its means Indeed an eternal entity cannot be produced by either action of Knowledge Objection: In that case ever exclusive Knowledge is purposeless Vedantin: No since Knowledge being the destroyer of ignorance culminates in Liberation which is directly experienced result The fact that Knowledge which removes the darkness of ignorance culminates in Liberation as its result is directly perceived in the same way as is the result of the light of a lamp which removes ignorance the form of sanke etc and darkness from objects such as rope etc Indeed the result of light amounts to the mere (awareness of the) rope free from the wrong notions of snake etc So is the case with Knowledge As in the case of the acts like 'cutting down' 'producing fire by friction' etc in which accessories such as the agent and others operate and which have perceivable results there is no possiblity of (the agent etc) engaging in any other activity giving some other result apart from 'splitting into two' 'seeing (or lighting of) fire' etc similarly in the case of the agent and the other factors engaged in the 'act' of steadfastness in Knowledge which has a tangible result there is no possibility of (their) engagement in any other action which has a result different from that in the form of the sole existence of the Self Hence steadfastness in Knowledge combined with action is not logical Objection: May it not be argued that this is possible like the acts of eating and Agnihotra sacrifice etc? [As such a common action as eating can go hand in hand with such Vedic rites as the Agnihotrasacrifice so actions can be combined with Knowledge] Vedantin: No since it is unreasonable that when Knowledge which resutls in Liberation is attained there can remain a hankering for results of actions Just as there is no desire for an action or its result [Action ie digging etc; result ie bathing etc] in connection with a well pond etc when there is a flood all around similarly when Knowledge which has Liberation for its result is attained there can be no possibility of hankering for any other result or any action which leads to it Indeed when somody is engaged in actions aimed at winning a kingdom there can be no possibility of his engaging in any activity for securing a piece of land or having a longing for it! Hence action does not constitute the means to the highest good Nor do Knowledge and action in combination Further Knowledge which has Liberation as its result can have no dependence on the assistance of action because being the remover of ignorance it is opposed (to action) Verily darkness cannot be the dispeller of darkness Therefore Knowledge alone is the means to the highest good Objection: Not so because from nonperformance of nityakarmas one incurs sin Besides freedom (of the Self) is eternal As for the view that Liberation is attainable through Knowledge alone it is wrong For if nityakarmas [As also the occasional duties (naimittikakarmas)] which are prescribed by the Vedas are not performed then one will incur evil in the form of going to hell etc Counterobjection: If this be so then since Liberation cannot come from action will there not arise the contingency of there being no Liberation at all? PseudoVedantin: Not so for Liberation is eternal as a result of performing nityakarmas there will not be incurring of evil and as a result of not doing any prohibited action (nisiddhakarma) there will not be any possibility of birth in an undesirable body; from relinishing actions meant for desired results (kamyakarmas) there will be no possibility of being born in some desirable body Since there is no cause to produce another body when the present body falls after the results of actions that produced this body get exhausted by experiencing them and since one does not have attachment etc therefore Liberation consists in the mere continuance of the Self in Its own natural state Thus Liberation is attained without effort Objection: May it not be argued that since in the case of actions done in many past liveswhich are calculated to yield such results as attainment of heaven hell etc but have not commenced bearing resultsthere is no possiblity of their being experienced therefore they cannot be exhausted? PseudoVedantin: No since the suffering of pain from the effort involved in the nityakarmas can reasonably be (considered to be) the experiencing of their [ie of actions done in past lives which have not commenced bearing their fruitsTr] results Or since the nityakarmas like expiations may be considered as being meant for eliminating the sins incurred earlier and since actions that have begun bearing their fruits get exhausted merely through their being experienced therefore Liberation is attained without effortprovided no fresh actions are performed Vedantin: No since there is the Upanisadic text 'Knowing Him alone one goes beyond death; there is no other way to go by' (Sv ) which states that for Liberation there is no other path but enlightenment; also because there is the Upanisadic statement that Liberation for an unenlightened person is as impossible as the rolling up of the sky like leather (Sv ); and since it is mentioned in the Puranas and the Smrtis that Liberation follows only from Knowledge (From your view) it also follows that there is no possibility of the exhaustion of the results of virtuous deeds which have not as yet begun yielding their fruits And as there is the possibility of the persistence of sins which were incurred in the past but have not yet commenced yielding results similarly there can be the possibility of the persistence of virtues which have not yet begun bearing fruits And so if there be no scope of their being exhausted without creating another body then there is no possibility of Liberation And since attachment hatred and delusion which are the causes of virtue and vice cannot be eradicated through any means other than Knowledge therefore the eradication of virtue and vice becomes impossible Besides since the Sruti [See Ch and Br Tr] mentions that nityakarmas have heaven as their result and there is the Smrti text 'Persons belonging to castes and stages of life and engaged in their own duties' ['৷৷attain to a high immeasurable happiness'Tr] (Ap Dh Su ) etc therefore the exhaustion of (the fruits of) actions (through nityakarmas) is not possible As for those who say 'The nityakarmas being painful in themselves must surely be the result of evil deeds done in the past; but apart from being what they are they have no other result because this is not mentioned in the Vedas and they are enjoined on the basis of the mere fact that one is alive'(this is) not so because actions which have not become operative cannot yield any result Besides there is no ground for experiencing a particular conseence in the form of pain [Pain involved in the performance of nityakarmas] The statement that the pain one suffers from the effort involved in performing the nityakarmas is the result of sinful acts done in past lives is false Indeed it does not stand to reason that the result of any action which did not become operative at the time of death to yield its fruit is experienced in a life produced by some other actions Otherwise there will be no reason why the fruit of some action that is to lead to hell should not be experienced in a life that is produced by such actions as Agnihotra etc and is meant for enjoying the result in the form of heaven! Besides that (pain arising from the effort in performing nityakarmas) cannot be the same as the conseence in the form of the particular suffering arising from sin Since there can be numerous kinds of sins with results productive of various kinds of sorrows therefore if it be imagined that their (sins') result will be merely in the form of pain arising from the effort in undertaking the nityakarmas then it will certainly not be possible to suppose that they (the sins incurred in the past) are the causes of such obstacles as the pairs of opposites (heat and cold etc) disease etc and that the result of sins incurred in the past will be only the pain arising from the exertion in performing nityakarmas but not the sufferings like carrying stones on the head etc Further it is out of context to say this that the pain resulting from the effort in performing nityakarmas is the result of sinful acts done in the past Objection: How? Vedantin: What is under discussion is that the sin committed in the past which has not begun to bear fruit cannot be dissipated In that context you say that pain resulting from the effort in undertaking nityakarmas is the result of action which has begun bearing fruit not of that which has not yet commenced yielding fruit! On the other hand if you think that all sins committed in the past have begun yielding their results then it is unreasonable to specify that the pain resulting from the exertion in performing the nityakarmas is their only result And there arises the contingency of the injunction to perform nityakarmas becoming void because the sinful deed which has begun bearing fruit can ligically be dissipated only be experiencing its result Further if pain be the result of nityakarmas enjoined by the Vedas then it is seen to arise from the very effort in undertaking nityakarmasas in the case of excercise etc To imagine that it is the result of something else is illogical [The pain arising from bodily excercise is the result of the excercise itself and not the result of any past sin! Similarly the pain resulting from undertaking nityakarmas is the conseence of that performance itself and need not be imagined to be the result of any past sin] And if the nityakarmas have been enjoined simply on the basis of a person's being alive it is unreasonable that it should be the result of sins committed in the past any more than expiation is An expiation that has been enjoined following a particular sinful act is not the result of that sin! On the other hand if the suffering arising from expiation be the reslut of that very sin which is its cause then the pain from the effort in performing nityakarmas though prescribed merely on the fact of one's being alive may become the fruit of that very fact of one's being alivewhich was itself the occasion (for enjoining the nityakarmas) because both the nityakarmas and expiatory duties are indistinguishable so far as their being occasioned by something is concerned Moreover there is the other fact: There can be no such distinction that only the pain resulting from the performance of nityakarmas is the result of past sinful deeds but not so the pain from performing kamyakarmas (rites and duties undertaken for desired results) because the pain in performing Agnihotrasacrifice etc is the same when it is performed as a nityakarma or as a kamyakarma Thus the latter also may be the result of past sinful acts This being the case it is untenable to assume on the ground of circumstantial inference that since no result is enjoined in the Vedas for nityakarmas and since its prescription cannot be justified on any other ground therefore pain from the effort in performing nityakarmas is the result of sinful past deeds Thus the (Vedic) injunction being unjustifiable otherwise it can be inferred that nityakarmas have got some result other than the pain arising from the effort in undertaking them It also involves this contradiction: It is contradictory to say that through the performance of nityakarma a result of some other action is experienced And when this is admitted it is again a contradiction to say that that very experience is the result of the nityakarma and yet that niyakarma has no result! Moreover when Agnihotra and other sacrifices are performed for desirable results (KamyaAgnihotra) then the Agnihotra etc which are performed as nityakarma (NityaAgnihotra) become accomplished simultaneously (on a account of its being a part ofthe former) Hence since the KamyaAgnihotra (as an act) is dependent on and not different from the NityaAgnihotra therefore the result of the Agnihotra and other sacrifices performed with a desire for results will get exhausted through the suffering involved in the exertion in undertaking it (the NityaAgnihotra) On the other hand if the result of KamyaAgnihotra etc be different viz heaven etc then even the suffering arising from the exertion in performing them ought to be necessarily different (from the suffering involved in the NityaAgnihotra) And that is not the fact because it contradicts what is directly perceived; for the pain resulting from the effort in performing only the Nitya(Agnihotra) does not differ from the pain resulting from the exertion in undertaking the Kamya (Agnihotra) Besides there is this other consideration: Actions which have not been enjoined or prohibited (by the scriptures) produce immediate results But those enjoined or prohibited by the scriptures do not produce immediate results; were they to do so then there would be no effort even with regard to heaven etc and injunctions concerning unseen results And it cannot be imagined that only the fruit of (Nitya) Agnihotra etc gets exhausted through the suffering arising from the effort in performing them but the Kamya (Agnihotra) has exalted results like heaven etc merely as a conseence of the fact of desire for results though as acts there is no essential difference between them (the Nitya and the Kamya) and there is no additional subsidiary part processes of performance etc (in the kamyaAgnihotra) Therefore it can never be established that nityakarmas have no unseen results And hence enlightenment alone not the performance of nityakarmas is the cuase of the total dissipation of actions done through ignorance be they good or bad For all actions have for their origin ignorance and desire Thus has it been established (in the following passages) that action (rites and duties) is meant for the ignorant and steadfastness in Knowledgeafter renunciation of all actionsis meant for the enlightened: 'both of them do not know' (); 'he who knows this One as indestructible eternal' (); 'through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization; through the Yoga of Action for the yogis' (); 'the ignorant who are attached to work' (); 'But৷৷the one who is a knower৷৷does not become attached thinking thus: ""The organs rest on the objects of the organs""' (); 'The embodied man৷৷having given up all actions mentally continues' (); 'Remaining absorbed in the Self the knower of Reality should think ""I certainly do not do anything""' (); ie; the unenlightened person thinks 'I do'; 'For (the sage) who wishes to ascend (to Dhyanayoga) action is said to be the means৷৷when he has ascended (when he is established in the Yoga of Meditation) inaction alone is said to be the means' (); 'noble indeed' are all the three (classes of) unenlightened persons 'but the man of Knowledge is the very Self (This is) My opinion' (); the unenlightened who perform their rites and duties 'who are desirous of pleasures attain the state of going and returning' (); 'becoming nondifferent from Me and meditative' () and endowed with steadfast devotion they worship (Me) the Self which has been described as comparable to space and taintless; and 'I grant that possession of wisdom by which they reach Me' (); ie the unenlightened persons who perform rites and duties 'do not reach Me' Those who perform works for the Lord and who though they be the most devout are ignorant persons performing rites and dutiesthey remain involved in practices which in a descending order culminate in giving up the fruit of actions (cf ) But those who meditate on the indefinable Immutable take recourse to the disciplines stated in the passages beginning with 'He who is not hateful towards any creature' () and ending with that Chapter and also resort to the path of Knowledge presented in the three chapters beginning with the Chapter on the 'field' The three results of actions viz the undesirable etc (cf ) do not accrue only to the mendicants belonging to the Order of Paramahamsas (the highest Order of monks)who have renounced all actions that originate from the five causes beginning with the locus (cf ) who possess the knowledge of the oneness and nonagentship of the Self () who continue in the supreme steadfastness in Knowledge who know the real nature of the Lord and who have taken refuge in the unity of the real nature of the Lord with the Self It does accrue to the others who are not monks the ignorant persons who perform rites and duties Such is this distinction made in the scripture Gita with regard to what is duty and what is not Objection: May it not be argued that it cannot be proved that all actions are due to ignorance? Reply: No (it can be proved) as in the case of slaying a Brahmin Although the nityakarmas are known from the scriptures still they are meant only for the ignorant As such an action as killing a Brahmin even though known to be a source of evil from the scripture prohibiting it is still perpetrated by one who has defects such as ignorance passion etcbecause impulsion to any action is otherwise not possible so also is it with regard to the nitya naimittika and kamya actions Objection: May it not be held that impulsion to nityakarma etc is not possible if the Self be not known as a distinct entity? [Unless one knows the Self to be distinct from the body etc he will not perform the nityakarmas etc meant for results in the other worlds viz heaven etc (Tr:) In place of vyatiriktatmani Ast reads 'dehavyatiriktatmani the Self which is distinct from the body'] Reply: No since it is seen that with regard to actions which are of the nature of motion and are accomplished by the notSelf one engages in them with the idea 'I do' [The actionless Self is not the agent of the movements of the body etc Still agentship is superimposed on It through ignorance] Objection: Can it not be said that the notion of egoism with regard to the aggregate of body etc occurs in a figurative sense; it is not false? Reply: No since its effects [ie the effects of the notion of egoism] also will become figurative Objection: The notion of 'I' with regard to the aggregate of one's own body etc occurs in a figurative sense As with regard to one's own son it is said (in the Veda) 'It is you yourself who is called the son' (Sa Br ) and in common parlance also it is said 'This cow is my very life' so is the case here [As the use of the word 'I' with regard to a son is figurative so also with regard to the body] This is certainly not a false notion However a false notion (of identity) occurs in the case of a stump and a man when the distinction between them is not evident (due to darkness) Reply: A figuratively expressed notion cannot lead to an effect in the real sense because that (notion) is used for the eulogy of its basis with the help of a word of comparison which remains understood As for instance such sentences as 'Devadatta is a lion' 'The boy is a fire'implying 'like a lion' 'like a fire' on the basis of the similarity of cruelty the tawny colour etcare meant only for eulogizing Devadatta and the boy who are the basis (ie the subjects of the two sentences) But no action of a lion or a fire is accomplished because of the use of the figurative words or ideas On the contrary one experiences the evil effects of false notions [Therefore the idea of 'I' with regard to one's body etc does not occur in a secondary sense but it does so falsely] And with regard to the subjects of the figurative notions one understands 'This Devadatta cannot be a lion; this boy cannot be a fire' Similarly actions done by the aggregate of body etc which is the 'Self' in a figurative sense cannot be held to have been done by the Self which is the real subject of the notion of 'I' For actions done by the figurative lion or fire cannot be considered to have been accomplished by the real lion or fire Nor is any action of the real lion and fire accomplished through the (figurative) cruelty or tawnyaness; for their purpose is fully served by being used for eulogy And those who are praised know 'I am not a lion; I am not fire; and neither is the work of a lion or fire mine' So the more ligical notion is 'The action of the aggregate (of body etc) do not belong to me who am the real Self' and not 'I am the agent; it is my work' As for the assertion made by some that the Self acts through Its own memory deisre and effort which are the causes of activitythat is not so for they are based on false knowledge Memory desire effort etc indeed follow from the tendencies born from the experience of the desirable and the undesirable results of actions (which actions themselves arise from the notions of the 'desirable' and the 'undesirable') caused by false knowledge [False knowledge gives rise to the ideas of the desirable and the undesirable From these arise desire and repulsion Actions which follow give rise to the experience of their desirable and undesirable results Such experiences create impressions in the mind from which are born memory etc] Just as in this life virtue vice and the experience of their results are cuased by the identification (of the Self) with the aggregate of body etc and attraction repulsion etc so also was it in the previous birth and even in the life preceding that Thus it can be inferred that past and future mundane existence is without beginning and is a product of ignorance And from this it becomes proved that the absolute cessation of mundane existence is caused by steadfastness in Knowledge accompanied by renunciation of all rites and duties Besides since selfidentification with the body is nothing but ignorance therefore when the (ignorance) ceases there remains so possibility of rebirth and so mundane existence becomes impossible The identification of the Self with the aggregate of body etc is nothing but ignorance because in common life it is not seen that anybody who knows 'I am different from cattle etc and the cattle etc are different from me' entertains the notion of 'I' with regard to them However mistaken perceiving a stump to be a man one may out of indiscrimination entertain the idea of 'I' with regard to the aggregate of body etc; not so when perceiving them as distinct As for that notion of considering the son to be oneselfas mentioned in 'It is you yourself who is called the son' (Sa Br ) that is a metaphor based on the relationship between the begotten and the begetter And no real action like eating etccan be accomplished through something considered metaphorically as the Self just as actions of the real lion or fire (cannot be accomplished) by someone metaphorically thought of to be a lion or fire Objection: Since an injunction relating to an unseen result is valid therefore may it not be said that the purposes of the Self are accomplished by the body and organs which are figuratively considered to be the Self? Reply: No since the thinking of them as the Self is the result of ignorance The body organs etc are not the Self in a figurative sense Objection: How then? Reply: Although the Self is devoid of relationship still by an ascription of relationship (to the Self) they (body etc) come to be regarded as the Self verily through a false notion For this identification (of body etc) with the Self exists so long as the false notion is there and ceases to exist when it is not there So long as ignorance lasts identification of the Self with the aggregate of body and organs is seen only in the case of nondiscriminating immature ignorant poeple who say 'I am tall' 'I am fair' But in the case of discriminating persons who possess the knowledge 'I am different from the aggregate of body etc' there does not arise the idea of egoism with regard to the body etc at that time (ie simultaneously with that knowledge) Hence since it (ie identification of the Self with the body etc) ceases in the absence of the false notion therefore it is a creation of that (false notion) and not a figurative notion It is only when the common and the uncommon features of the lion and Devadatta or of fire and the boy are known distinctly that a figurative notion or verbal expression can occur; not when the common and the uncommon features are unknown As for the argument that (the figurative notion should be accepted) on the authority of the Vedas we say 'No' because their validity concerns unseen results The validity of the Vedas holds good only with regard to matters concerning the relation between ends and means of Agnihotra etc which are not known through such valid means of knowledge as direct perception; but not with regard to objects of direct perception etc because the validity of the Vedas lies in revealing what is beyond direct perception Therefore it is not possible to imagine that the idea of egism with regard to the aggregate of body etc arising from an obviously of false knowledge is a figurative notion Surely even a hundred Vedic texts cannot become valid if they assert that fire is cold or nonluminous! Should a Vedic text say that fire is cold or nonluminous even then one has to assume that the intended meaning of the text is different for otherwise (its) validity cannot be maintained; but one should not assume its meaning in a way that might contradict some other valid means of knowledge or contradict its own statement Objection: May it not be said that since actions are undertaken by one possessed of a false idea of agentship therefore when the agent ceases to be so ['According to you (the Vedantin) an ignorant man alone can be an agent Therefore when he becomes illumined he will cease to be ignorant and conseently the Vedas will cease to be valid for him'] the Vedas will become invalid? Reply: No since the Vedas become logically meaningful in respect of knowledge of Brahman [Though the Vedic injunctions about rituals etc be inapplicable in the case of an enlightened person still they have empirical validity before enlightenment Besides the Vedas have real validity with regard to the knowledge of Brahman] Objection: May it not be said that there arises the contingency of the Vedic texts enjoining knowledge of Brahman becoming as invalid as those texts enjoining rites and duties? Reply: No since there cannot possibly be any notion which can remove (the knowledge of Brahman) Unlike the manner in which the idea of egoism with regard to the aggregate of body etc is removed after the realization of the Self from hearing the Vedic injunctions regarding the knowledge of Brahman the realization of the Self in the Self can never be removed in any way in that manner by anything whatsoeverjust as the knowledge that fire is hot and luminous is irremovable since (Self) realization is inseparable from its result (ie cessation of ignorance) Besides the Vedic texts enjoining rites (and duties) etc are not invalid because they through the generation of successively newer tendencies by eliminating the successively preceding tendencies are meant for creating the tendency to turn towards the indwelling Self [The Vedic injunctions make people up rituals etc by giving up their earlier worldly tendencies Thery their minds become purified The purified mind then aspires to know the indwelling Self Thus since the ritualistic injunctions are meant for making a person turn towards the knowledge ofthe indwelling Self they are not invalid] Although the means be unreal (in itself) still it may be meaningful in relation to the truth of the purpose it serves as are the eulogistic sentences (arthavada) [See note on p Tr] occuring along with injunctions Even in the world when it becomes necessary to make to child or a lunatic drink milk etc it is said that it will help growth of hair [Cuda lit hair on the top of the head; or single lock of hair left on the crown of the head after tonsure See VSA] etc! Before the dawn of Knowledge the (ritualistic) Vedic texts concerned with a different situation [The situation obtaining before the dawn of Selfknowledge] are also as valid in themselves as are direct perception etc occuring due to Selfidentification with the body etc On the other hand as for your view 'The Self though inactive by Itself acts through Its mere proximity; and that itself constitutes agentship of the Self in the primary sense Just as it is well known that a king though not himself engaged in a battle is merely by virtue of his being in charge said to be fighting when his soldiers are fighting and that he is victorious or defeated; similarly as the ?nder of an army acts through his mere orders and it is seen that the results of the actions accrue to the king or to the ?nder; or just as the actions of the priests are ascribed to the sacrificerin that very manner are the actions done by the body etc ought to be of the Self because the result of those actions accrues to the Self And as the agentship of a magnet which in fact is not active is attributed to it in the primary sense because it causes a piece of iron to move similar is the agentship of the Self'that is wrong since it will amunt to an inactive entity becoming an agent Objection: May not agentship be of various kinds? Reply: No for in the case of the 'king' and others it is seen that they have agentship even in the primary sense As for the king he fights even through his personal engagement And he has agentship in the primary sense by virtue of making (his) warriors fight distributing wealth and also reaping the fruits of victory or defeat Similarly the agentship of a sacrificer is primary by virtue of his offering the main oblation and giving gifts due to the priests Therefore it is understood that the agentship which is attributed to an inactive entity is figurative If primary agentship consisting in their personal engagement is not perceived in the case of the king a sacrificer and others then it could be assumed that they have primary agentship owing to the mere fact of their presence just as a magnet has by virtue of making the iron move But in the case of the king and others it is not perceived that they have no personal engagement in that way Therefore even the agentship owing to mere presence is a figurative one And if that be so the connection with the result of such agentship will also be figurative No action in the primary sense is performed by an agent figuratively thought to be so Hence the assertion is certainly wrong that owing to the activities of the body etc the actionless Self becomes an agent and experiencer But everything becomes possible due to error This is just as it happens in dream or in jugglery! Besides in deep sleep absorption in Brahman etc where the current of the mistaken idea of Selfidentity with the body etc ceases evils like agentship enjoyership etc are not perceived Therefore this delusion of mundane existence is surely due to false knowledge; but it is not reality Conseently it is established that it ceases absolutely as a result of full enlightenment Having summed up in this chapter the import of the whole of the scripture Gita and having again summarized it specially here at the end (in verse ) for the sake of emphasizing the purport of the Scripture now after that the Lord states the rules for handing down the Scripture:",,,'Relinishing all Dharmas means the complete relinishment of the sense of agency possessiveness fruits etc in the practising of Karma Jnana and Bhakti Yogas in the way instructed and the realising of Me as the agent object of worship the means and the end It means that relinishment is not of all devotional duties but only of the sense of agency and the fruits This is the Sastraic relinishment of all Dharmas It is firmly established in the beginning of this chapter commencing from 'Listen regarding My decision O Arjuna about abandonment; for abandonment is declared to be of three kinds' () and 'Renouncing attachments and also the fruit such abandonment is regarded as Sattvika ৷৷ for it is impossible for one who bears the body to abandon acts entirely But he who gives up the fruits of works is called the abandoner' () If you practise such abandonment of the sense of agency and fruits I will release you from all 'sins' ie I will release you from all evil incompatible with the attainment of Myself consisting of innumerable acts of the nature of doing what ought not to be done and not doing what ought to be done These piled up from beginningless times from the obstruction in the way Grieve not you should not despair; for I shall release you from all these obstructions Another (alternative) explanation is this: Bhakti Yoga is possible only for those people to whom the Lord is exceedingly dear and who are free from all evils Those evils are so huge in their case that the expiatory rites which could wash them off could not be performed in the limited time of one's life span Ajuna therefore thought that he was unfit for commencing Bhakti Yoga To remove the grief of Arjuna the Lord said: 'Completely relinishing all Dharmas seek Me alone for refuge' Expiatory rites can be taken here as what is meant by Dharma Completely forsake these rites (Dharmas) appropriate for the removal of numerous and varied sins piled up from beginningless time and obstructing the starting of Bhakti Yoga The expiatory rites consist of practices like Krcchra Candrayana Kusmanda Vaisvanara Vratapati Pavitresti Trvrit Agnistoma etc which are of manifold varieties and which are difficult to perform on account of the brevity of life So in order to succeed in commencing Bhakti Yoga seek Me alone for refuge I am supremely compassionate the refuge of all without considering the differences of character among them and am an ocean of tenderness for those dependent on Me I will release you from all evil the nature of which has been explained as incompatible with the commencement of Bhakti Yoga Grieve not [Both these interpretations of this famous verse are said to teach only Bhakti Yoga and not Prapatti But the estion will rise in one's mind why should it not be so taken?]
